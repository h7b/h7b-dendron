## What is a Digital Marketing campaign?
A Digital Marketing campaign is the execution of a marketing strategy across digital platforms, typically aimed at optimizing a business’s conversion rate. Through Digital Marketing campaigns, brands create a way for consumers to engage with them and their content. However, the objective may vary from campaign to campaign. For instance, a campaign can be created to build a bigger follower base, increase engagement with existing customers, create a brand image, sell a product or service, etc.

The campaign should focus on the following three primary aspects:
- SEO: A good SEO score is a sign that your marketing campaign is going well.
- Brand awareness: Brand awareness is key to get your products/services easily recognized.
- Social media followers: The number of followers determines the audience’s interest in the business.

## Steps to Build a Digital Marketing Strategy
A Digital Marketing strategy is a plan that is specifically designed to meet business goals and objectives with the help of online Digital Marketing. This type of marketing is achieved through relevant online marketing channels and aims for optimized returns and performance. 

It is crucial to have the ability to identify the platforms that can deliver a larger crowd of prospective buyers. Otherwise, the effort put into advertising in the wrong place is as good as the money and effort wasted. 

### 1. Understanding Your Audience

You have to identify what aspect of your product or service they like. Where are these customers mostly from? What is the age group that your business is catering to? Knowing so will help you identify your demographic.

### 2. Not Losing Sight of the End Result

A Digital Marketing strategy should be designed keeping in mind a reason for your customers to keep coming back to your products and services. 

### 3. Content Marketing

Create resourceful and relevant content to draw in and engage your audience. Publishing and distributing content that can be useful to your audience will increase brand awareness and help establish a relationship with them as they progress through the sales funnel. Besides, it is a less costly strategy. However, it can take some time for your content library to grow and reach a larger audience.

### 4. Digital Marketing Campaigns

A Digital Marketing campaign requires utmost dedication and attention to detail throughout its entire duration— from conception to its execution. Devising a campaign involves a lot more than simple advertising or branding on social media or other websites. It involves realistically assessing the campaign budget, defining goals, as well as coming up with a detailed persona of your ideal customer, which includes information such as age, occupation, and any variable that may determine how likely they are to spend on your product or service. SEO and social media play a big part in this too.
