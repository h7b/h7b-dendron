# Compute cost basis of stocks with FIFO method in Google Sheets

ref: [allstacksdeveloper](https://www.allstacksdeveloper.com/2022/09/fifo-stock-portfolio-google-sheets.html)

## Situation

After selling a portion of current holdings in a stock, the cost basis for remaining shares of that stock in my portfolio is not simply the sum of all transactions. Hence, I learn the implementation of a formula to calculate the `Realized Gain/Loss`, applying the FIFO (first in, first out) accounting method.

Read more about the custom formula at [[here|notes.daily.2022-11-16.create-trading-spreadsheet.fifo-stock-portfolio.script]].
