# Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp)

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a companyâ€™s total liabilities to its shareholder equity and can be used to evaluate how much leverage a company is using.

## Formula

$$Debt/Equity = \frac{Total\ Liabilities}{Equity}$$

## Understanding Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio

Higher-leverage ratios tend to indicate a company or stock with higher risk to shareholders.

Investors will often modify the D/E ratio to focus on long-term debt only because the risks associated with long-term liabilities are different than short-term debt and payables.

As a rule, short-term debt tends to be cheaper than long-term debt, meaning cost of capital for capital with short-term debt are lower than peers with long-term debt.

Different industries have different capital needs and growth rates, it is very important to consider the industry in which the company operates when using the D/E ratio.
- Utility stocks (consumer staples or consumer non-cyclical sector) often have a very high D/E ratio compared to market averages. A utility grows slowly but is usually able to maintain a steady income stream, which allows these companies to borrow cheaply
