# Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)

The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period.

## Formula

$$PEG=\frac{P/E\ ratio}{EPS\ Growth}$$

where
- $P/E\ ratio=\frac{Price\ per\ Share}{EPS}$
- $EPS\ Growth$ = the expected growth rate of the [[Earnings per Share|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.earnings-per-share]]

## Understanding PEG ratio

The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.

The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator of a stock's true value, and similar to the P/E ratio, a lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued given its future earnings expectations.

The PEG for a given company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation, such as one-year or three-year projected growth.

As a broad rule of thumb, some investors feel that a PEG ratio below 1 is desirable.
