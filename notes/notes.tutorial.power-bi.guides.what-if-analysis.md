# Use what-if parameters to visualize variables in Power BI

ref: [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-what-if)

You can create what-if variables for your reports, interact with the variable as a slicer, and visualize and quantify different key values in your reports.

The Power BI Desktop what-if parameter is a feature that creates a disconnected table to accept "user input", allowing model calculations to use the input value in a meaningful way.

A disconnected table is a model table that
- isn't related to another model table, 
- isn't intended to propagate filters to other model tables
