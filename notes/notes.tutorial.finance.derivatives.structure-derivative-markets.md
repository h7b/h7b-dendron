# Structure of Derivative Markets

Equities trade on organized exchanges as well as in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. These exchange-traded equity markets — such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange — are formal organizational structures that bring buyers and sellers together through market makers, or dealers, to facilitate transactions. Exchanges have formal rule structures and are required to comply with all securities laws.

The derivatives world also comprises organized exchanges and OTC markets.

Derivative instruments are created and traded either on an exchange or on the OTC market. 
- Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized, 
- whereas OTC derivatives are customized.

## Exchange-Traded Derivatives Markets

To standardize a derivative contract means that its terms and conditions are precisely specified by the exchange and there is very limited ability to alter those terms. For example,
- an exchange might offer trading in certain types of derivatives that expire only on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. If a party wanted the derivative to expire on any other day, it would not be able to trade such a derivative on that exchange. 
- If a party wanted a derivative on a particular entity, such as a specific stock, that party could trade it on that exchange only if the exchange had specified that such a derivative could trade

This standardization of contract terms facilitates the creation of a more liquid market for derivatives.

The cornerstones of the exchange-traded derivatives market are the market makers (or dealers) and the speculators.

With standardization of terms and an active market, market makers are often able to buy and sell almost simultaneously at different prices, locking in small, short-term profits, a process commonly known as scalping.

Standardization also facilitates the creation of a clearing and settlement operation
- **Clearing** refers to the process by which the exchange verifies the execution of a transaction and records the participants’ identities
- **Settlement** refers to the related process in which the exchange transfers money from one participant to the other or from a participant to the exchange or vice versa

Derivatives exchanges clear and settle all contracts overnight, whereas most securities exchanges require two business days.

If two parties engage in a derivative contract on an exchange, one party will ultimately make money and the other will lose money. Derivatives exchanges use their clearinghouses to provide a guarantee to the winning party that if the loser does not pay, the clearinghouse will pay the winning party. The clearinghouse is able to provide this credit guarantee by requiring a cash deposit, usually called the **margin bond** or **performance bond**, from the participants to the contract.

Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized, highly regulated, and transparent transactions that are guaranteed against default through the clearinghouse of the derivatives exchange.

## Over- the- Counter Derivatives Markets

The OTC derivatives markets comprise an *informal* network of market participants that are willing to create and trade virtually any type of derivative that can legally exist. The backbone of these markets is the set of dealers, which are typically banks. Most of these banks are members of a group called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), a worldwide organization of financial institutions that engage in derivative transactions.
- It is *informal* because the dealers are not obligated to do so. Their participation is based on a desire to profit

Over-the-counter derivatives are customized, flexible, and more private and less regulated than exchange-traded derivatives, but are subject to a greater risk of default.
