# obsidian-zola

- GitHub: https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola
- Thoughts:
    - use GitHub repo, deployed via Netlify
    - static site generated by [zola](https://www.getzola.org/)
    - [demo page](https://peteryuen.netlify.app/). Take a look at the author's [demo repo](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-pkm) to learn how he structured his vault
    - The template have left-side nav bar, right-side TOC, search box, nodes graph
    - This repo is not a plugin, just a simple method to publish an Obsidian vault
    - currently this is the most beautiful and polished alternative of `Obsidian Publish`
