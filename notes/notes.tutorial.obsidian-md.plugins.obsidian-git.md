# Obsidian Git

- GitHub: https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git
- Thoughts:
    - plugin that allows you to back up your Obsidian.md vault to a remote git repository
    - This plugin does not work on mobile
    - [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.obsidian-git-mobile]] is an alternative that will work on Obsidian mobile app.
