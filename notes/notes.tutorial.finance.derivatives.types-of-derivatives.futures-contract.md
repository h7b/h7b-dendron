# Futures Contract

A futures contract is similar to a forward contract but is a **standardized derivative** contract created and traded on a futures exchange. 

In the contract, two parties agree that 
- one party, the buyer, will purchase an underlying asset 
- from the other party, the seller, 
- at a later date and at a price agreed on by the two parties when the contract is initiated. 
- In addition, there is a daily settling of gains and losses and a credit guarantee by the futures exchange through its clearinghouse.

Probably the most important distinctive characteristic of futures contracts is the daily settlement of gains and losses and the associated credit guarantee provided by the exchange through its clearinghouse.

When a party buys a futures contract, it commits to purchase the underlying asset at a later date and at a price agreed upon when the contract is initiated. The counterparty (the seller) makes the opposite commitment, an agreement to sell the underlying asset at a later date and at a price agreed upon when the contract is initiated. The agreed-upon price is called the **futures price**.

At the end of each day, the clearinghouse engages in a practice called **mark to market**, also known as the **daily settlement**. The clearinghouse determines an average of the final futures trades of the day and designates that price as the **settlement price**. All contracts are then said to be marked to the settlement price. All contracts are then said to be *marked to the settlement price*.
- For example, if the long purchases the contract during the day at a futures price of £120 and the settlement price at the end of the day is £122, the long’s account would be marked for a gain of £2. In other words, the long has made a profit of £2 and that amount is credited to his account, with the money coming from the account of the short, who has lost £2.

The account is specifically referred to as a **margin account**. With futures margin accounts, both parties deposit a required minimum sum of money, but the remainder of the price is not borrowed. This required margin is typically less than 10% of the futures price, which is referred to as the **initial margin**. Both the long and the short put that amount into their respective margin accounts. This money is deposited there to support the trade, not as a form of equity, with the remaining amount borrowed. There is no formal loan created as in equity markets.

Associated with each initial margin is another figure called the **maintenance margin**. The maintenance margin is the amount of money that each participant must maintain in the account after the trade is initiated, and it is always significantly lower than the initial margin.
- Going on with the previous example, let us assume that the maintenance margin is £6. If the buyer’s account is marked to market with a credit of £2, his margin balance moves to $£10 + £2$, while the seller’s account is charged £2 and his balance moves to $£10 - £2$. The clearinghouse then compares each participant’s balance with the maintenance margin. At this point, both participants more than meet the maintenance margin.
- A few days later, assume that the short’s balance falls to £4, which is below the maintenance margin requirement of £6. The short will then get a **margin call**, which is a request to deposit additional funds. The short must deposit enough funds to bring the balance up to the initial margin, £10 in this example. So, the short must come up with £6.
- A party can choose not to deposit additional funds, in which case the party would be required to close out the contract as soon as possible and would be responsible for any additional losses until the position is closed.

As with forward contracts, neither party pays any money to the other when the contract is initiated. Value accrues as the futures price changes, but at the end of each day, the mark-to-market process settles the gains and losses, effectively resetting the value for each party to zero. The clearinghouse moves money between the participants, crediting gains to the winners and charging losses to the losers.

At any given time, the number of outstanding contracts is called the **open interest**. Each contract counted in the open interest has a long and a corresponding short.

Forward contracts realize the full amount, $S_T – f_0(T)$, at expiration, whereas futures contracts realize this amount in parts on a day-to-day basis. Naturally, the time value of money principle says that these are not equivalent amounts of money. But the differences tend to be small, particularly in low-interest-rate environments, some of these amounts are gains and some are losses, and most futures contracts have maturities of less than a year.
- In a forward contact, with the entire payoff made at expiration, a loss by one party can be large enough to trigger a default. Hence, forward contracts are subject to default and require careful consideration of the credit quality of the counterparties.
- Because futures contracts settle gains and collect losses daily, the amounts that could be lost upon default are much smaller and naturally give the clearinghouse much greater flexibility to manage the credit risk it assumes.
