## Notes from reading

A visual of a human 90-year lifespan. It shows that he has around 60 winters left until his 90. It is both enlightening and sobering, when I think of how much time left for me and my parents.

The author's thoughts woke me up, when thinking about my parents, who are also in their early-60s. Being optimistic that I have both parents alive into my 60s, that will give us about 30 more years of coexistence.
