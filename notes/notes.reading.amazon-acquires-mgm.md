## Notes from reading

The news itself is not exceptional, just proving the fact that 
- streaming services will be balkanized, 
- consumers need to unhappily subscribe to many concurrent providers to watch all the shows they have interest in, like the old days of cable TV

With such hindrance, would the trend of content piracy resurrect?

Nowadays, nobody with average knowledge will use open source bittorrent client like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [BiglyBT](https://www.biglybt.com/) to search for pirated content, because of legal issues. They can find other alternatives, such as
- Search for private free or paid Plex server in [Plex shares reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/plexshares/), with a [tweaked](https://appdb.to/app/cydia/1900000472) iOS app to be sideloaded
- Spin up a personal media server using [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
- [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) is another option, with a [r/StremioAddons](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/) or [an addon-curated-list](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/blob/main/README.md) to explore if you want to go down the road of torrent
    - If you get notices from ISP in your country when using Stremio with torrent links (see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stremio/comments/usig1f/vpn_with_stremio/)), you better switch to [RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com/)
    - You can configure RealDebrid to be used with [torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) addon for Stremio
    - Or setup [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) with RealDebrid is another option
- [CloudStream-3](https://github.com/LagradOst/CloudStream-3) is another app to stream movies, tv shows and anime. Android only
- [Nine Animator](https://github.com/SuperMarcus/NineAnimator) is a free and open source anime watching app for iOS (sideloaded) and macOS
