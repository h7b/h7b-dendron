# List of Web Browsers

[Opera](https://www.opera.com/)
- Thoughts: 
    - I use [Flow](https://www.opera.com/features/flow) feature to share links between Opera on my laptop and [Opera on iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1411869974)
    - I also use the [beta and developer channel](https://www.opera.com/computer/beta) as separate instances.

[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
- Thoughts: 
    - I use both the normal and [insider channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/)
    - normal for temporary view, where cookies and tmp files will be deleted on closing browser
    - Beta channel for media consuming
    - Dev channel as personal workspace

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- Thoughts: I install both the stable version and [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/). The Beta and Nightly version can be found [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/)

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Thoughts: I install both the normal and [Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/)

[Aloha Browser](https://alohabrowser.com/)
- Thoughts: serve as my main browser on iOS. I also test their [desktop version](https://alohabrowser.com/pc/). Though the sync features between mobile and desktop is not ready to use (2021-12-17). Chromium.

[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)
- Thoughts: Privacy-focused browser. I use this as my corporate working space. Chromium

[Brave](https://brave.com/)
- Thoughts: just use by curiosity. Nothing too impressive. I expect that the content publisher will receive my donations with BAT token generated from ads display. Chromium

[Dot Browser](https://www.dothq.co/en)
- Thoughts: based on Firefox. Privacy-focused browser

[Iridium Browser](https://iridiumbrowser.de/)
- Thoughts: Privacy-focused browser. Don't have auto update feature. Chromium

[Sidekick](https://www.meetsidekick.com/)
- Thoughts: browser designed for work? I still cannot understand their unique selling point. Chromium

[Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/)
- Thoughts: based on Firefox. Privacy-focused browser

[Stack](https://stackbrowser.com/)
- Thoughts: Pricing plan starts at USD 8.4/month, with free tier. Can open multiple accounts (eg. gmail) in one instance.

[Webcatalog](https://webcatalog.io/webcatalog/)
- Thoughts: same feature (multiple account in one instance) as [Stack](https://stackbrowser.com/)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
- Thoughts: against tracking, surveillance, and censorship. I use it to search for academic articles on Sci-Hub, [Library Genesis](http://libgen.li/), [Z Library](https://z-lib.org/)

[Bonsai](https://bonsaibrowser.com/)
- Thoughts: still cannot understand what's the use case of this app. Uninstalled.

[Orion Browser by Kagi](https://browser.kagi.com/)
- Orion is an alternative browser for Apple users, open to the web and all its standards and protocols
- Unlike Safari, Orion has native support for both Chrome and Firefox extensions
- Orion is as fast or faster than Safari, because both use the WebKit engine
- available for Apple macOS, iPadOS and iOS

[Synth](https://synth.app/)
- the browser for research
- 2022-08-03, currently for invites only

[Beam](https://beamapp.co/)
- the browser for research, with ability to write and publish notes
