# Three stages of Growth

According to *Sharpe, Alexander, and Bailey 1999* [^1], growth falls into three stages:
- Growth phase
    - A company in its growth phase typically enjoys rapidly expanding markets, high profit margins, and an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share
    - Companies in this phase often have negative free cash flow to equity because the company invests heavily in expanding operations
    - Given high prospective returns on equity, the dividend payout ratios of growth-phase companies are often low or even zero
    - As the companyâ€™s markets mature or as unusual growth opportunities attract competitors, earnings growth rates eventually decline
- Transition phase
    - In this phase, which is a transition to maturity, earnings growth slows as competition puts pressure on prices and profit margins or as sales growth slows because of market saturation
    - earnings growth rates may be above average but declining toward the growth rate for the overall economy
    - Capital requirements typically decline in this phase, often resulting in positive free cash flow and increasing dividend payout ratios (or the initiation of dividends)
- Mature phase
    - In maturity, the company reaches an equilibrium in which investment opportunities on average just earn their opportunity cost of capital
    - The dividend and earnings growth rate of this phase is called the **mature growth rate**
    - This phase reflects the stage in which a company can properly be valued using the Gordon growth model
