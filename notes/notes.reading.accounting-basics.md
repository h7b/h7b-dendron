## Notes from reading

Notion of debit/credit:
- *DEBITS* represent the flow of economic benefit to a destination
- *CREDITS* represent the flow of economic benefit from a source

Notion of Assets/Liabilities:
- *Assets*: future economic benefit
- *Liabilities*: future economic sacrifice

I also found that this interpretation of the basic equation of Accounting is easier to understand.

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Assets = Liabilities + (Owner's Equity - Dividends + Retained Earnings)

Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity - Dividends + (Revenue - Expenses)

or can be rewritten as:

Assets + Dividends + Expenses = Liabilities + Owner's Equity + Revenue

which leads to
- the accounts on the left side of equation *INCREASE* when *DEBITED*
- the accounts on the right side of equation *INCREASE* when *CREDITED*

or a trick to memorize when to Debit/Credit
![trick-to-memorize](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/Screenshot_2022-02-13_002534_oh4oNR5xS.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1644708382880){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

There are 2 definitions of *Equity*
1. *Equity* is the residual value of an entity's *Assets* after deducting all of its *Liabilities*  
  or the basic equation: Equity = Assets - Liabilities
2. *Equity* represents the net funds invested into a business by its owners
  or Equity = Capital Contributions + Retained Earnings
![equity](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/Screenshot_2022-02-13_003901_0ot3jrLcp.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1644709163430){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

Some jargons and their equivalents for each type of entity's ownership:
![terminology](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/Screenshot_2022-02-13_005728_xBO3q-IxY.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1644710262173){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

- Temporary accounts: *Revenue*, *Expenses*, *Dividends*
  - closing balance at the end of accounting period is reset to 0
- Permanent accounts: *Assets*, *Liabilities*, *Equity*
  - closing balance at the end of accounting period is carried forward into next term

Accrual basis of accounting
- Revenue recognition: *Revenue* is recognized as it's earned, not when *Cash* is received
- Matching principles: *Expenses* are  recorded as they incurred, not when *Cash* is paid out

Cash flow statements
- prepared by *Direct Method*
  - suitable for small firm
  - easier to read for investors
  - costly and time-consuming for accountants in large companies to do
  ![direct-method](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/Screenshot_2022-02-13_103258_coyWSYxUYQ0.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1644745019698){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- prepared by *Indirect Method*
  - preferred by large companies
  - far less intuitive to understand for investors
  ![indirect-method](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/Screenshot_2022-02-13_103633_JNHhTJOfF.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1644745019995){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- These 2 methods is differentiated by their layout of *Cash Flow from Operating Activities*. Or, the *Cash Flow from Investing and Financing Activities* are identical in both methods

Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

*Accrued Expense*: is a past expense that hasn't been recorded or paid for yet
- example: you receive your utility bill (water, gas) every 3 months, but you have to record accrued expense for your monthly consumption

*Accrued Revenue*: is revenue that has been earned in the past but not invoiced yet, aka unbilled revenue

*Prepaid Expense*: is a future expense which has been paid for in advance
- example: on Dec 2021, you have to pay $100 for insurance in period starting from Jan 2022
