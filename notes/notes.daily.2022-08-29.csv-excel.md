# Open UTF-8 csv files by double-clicking in Excel

Asked in [superuser](https://superuser.com/questions/1704749/open-utf-8-csv-files-by-double-clicking-in-excel). 

It is not possible to open a UTF-8 csv file by simple double-clicking in Excel.

I must use the import feature "Get Data > From File > From Text/CSV". In the query panel, there will be a box to select encoding method.

The [CSV file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) has no provision for describing character encoding. The encoding is usually set at the receiving end. [^1]
