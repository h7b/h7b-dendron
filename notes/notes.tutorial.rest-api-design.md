# REST API Best Practices â€“ REST Endpoint Design Examples

ref: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples/)

REST stands for Representational State Transfer

Any API (Application Programming Interface) that follows the REST design principle is said to be RESTful. 

A REST API is a medium for two computers to communicate over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), in the same way clients and servers communicate.

## REST API Design Best Practices

- Use JSON as the Format for Sending and Receiving Data
- Use Nouns Instead of Verbs in Endpoints
- Name Collections with Plural Nouns
- Use Status Codes in Error Handling
- Use Nesting on Endpoints to Show Relationships
- Use Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination to Retrieve the Data Requested
- Use SSL for Security
- Be Clear with Versioning
    - the commonest versioning systems is semantic versioning
    - An example of semantic versioning is 1.0.0, 2.1.2, and 3.3.4. 
        - The first number represents the major version, 
        - the second number represents the minor version, 
        - and the third represents the patch version.
- Provide Accurate API Documentation
