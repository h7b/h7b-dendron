# My thoughts

- Current portfolio of 85% stocks and 15% bonds has significant weaker performance vs market index (S&P500) within the same timeframe (see figure below)
- Low annual management fee (0.25% AUM [^1]) compared to certain mutual fund. But still more expensive than other ETF provider like Vanguard
- Tax-loss-harvesting feature did not justify its value
- Tax statements provided by Betterment are clear and concise. Though I don't have experience with other institutions, so this is opinionated
- Will it be more cost-effective if I find a way to hold directly ETF and ignore the Tax-loss-harvesting feature?

Update 2022-11-15:
- Betterment changes its annual price from 0.25% into USD 4/month [^2]
- If your Betterment balance is $15k, you now pay $48 per year vs. $37.50 per year. So it's $10 more expensive per year, for my account.
