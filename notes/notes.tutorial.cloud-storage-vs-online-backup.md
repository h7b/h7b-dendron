# Cloud Storage vs Online Backup: What’s The Difference

ref: [Cloudwards](https://www.cloudwards.net/online-storage-vs-online-backup-whats-the-difference/)

## The Difference

I curated my own [list of pricing plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1enE0KFKkUm9rvMB4zG1A8Qn5OlCTEswAAe7ztVlvoHo/edit?usp=sharing) of cloud storage and online backup services.

Cloud storage solution: 
- The vital purpose of cloud storage is to supplement your hard drive. Cloud storage is an extension of the physical storage capability of your device
- Sync: cloud storage feature that lets you edit a file on one device and have those edits reflected on another device in near real-time
- Share: the ability to let others view, edit or download files you’ve uploaded to your cloud storage space
- Cloud storage solutions are not really suitable for hard-drive backup since they don’t retain your file-system structure because you end up having to put everything into a sync folder.

Online backup services:
- Aim to replicate your hard drive, for disaster recovery.
- Retain your file system structure and let you restore everything back the way it was in case you need to rebuild your hard drive

Another funny written [marketing piece from Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-case-for-backup-over-sync/) comparing their backup solution vs other sync services, might give the reason to consider to buy their subscription

## Multi-cloud management app

### Spacedrive

[Spacedrive](https://www.spacedrive.com/) is a FREE app that allows you to manage files across all devices, drives and clouds at once.

Spacedrive is not a storage provider. Spacedrive is simply a database that exists on top of existing storage layers, from cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive and iCloud to physical devices and external drives you already own. It doesn't provide you more storage, rather a supercharged view of your existing storage.
