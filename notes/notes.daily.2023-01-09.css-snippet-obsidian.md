# How to use CSS snippet in Obsidian

ref: [minimal.guide](https://minimal.guide/Extras/CSS+snippets)

## Overview

Snippets are CSS files that allow you to create your own personal customizations on top of or any [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme.

You can install snippets by adding CSS files to the `.obsidian/snippets` folder in your vault, and activating them in Obsidian by going to `Settings` → `Appearance`.

Snippets are only recommended for advanced users who are comfortable with CSS.

Most common features of a theme can be more easily customized via its own theme-setting plugin or [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

## My use case

I want to use the [extended color shceme](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin#colorschemes-used) of the [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.anuppuccin]] theme.

Steps to install
1. Create the `.obsidian/snippets` folder in my vault
2. Download manually the [css snippet](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/blob/main/snippets/extended-colorschemes.css) and put in the `snippets` folder which was previously created
    - Or I can use the [Snippet Downloader](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/obsidian-snippet-downloader) plugin to manage any snippet in batch
3. Go to `Obsidian` → `Settings` → `Appearance`, then toggle the snippet on
4. Go to `Obsidian` → `Style Settings` → `AnuPpuccin Themes Extended` to choose the color scheme.
