# Track Daily History

## Situation

- I want
    - to automatically record a daily history of values in `pnl` sheet
    - to force refreshing `IMPORTXML` function in `tmp_currentPrice` sheet, while the document is not opened
- Reason: watch the daily performance of my portfolio, to learn when I missed the chance to realize the profit.

## Custom script

Read [[here|notes.daily.2022-11-16.stock-trading-spreadsheet.track-daily-history.script_suggestion]] to learn my thinking process when finding suggestion, and [[here|notes.daily.2022-11-16.stock-trading-spreadsheet.track-daily-history.my_version]] to remind what did I learn from writing my own version.
