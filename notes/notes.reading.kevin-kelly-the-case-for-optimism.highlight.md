# Notes from reading [[notes.reading.kevin-kelly-the-case-for-optimism]]

## why we should adopt the stance of optimism whenever we can?

- Pre-visualize success
    - It is extremely difficult to create a desirable future without first envisioning it. To imagine is really the first step in creating anything. Therefore an essential chore for making a future we want to live in, is to imagine what it is like and how we get there. That plausible path is a form of optimism.
    - Believing it is possible makes it more likely to happen
    - Since we can not be certain of the future, optimism is only a belief -- a stance that could be incorrect
    - On the surface, an optimistic belief might seem no more valid than the stance of pessimism. But the deep history of new ideas makes it very clear that the optimistic stance of believing something is possible is a requirement to make anything new real, and is thus more powerful than pessimism
- Civilization requires optimism
    - Civilization depends on an implicit degree of general optimism. It is a collaborative exercise. Civilization amplifies and accumulates cooperation between strangers. If you expect that you can trust a stranger, that is optimism. If you expect to be cheated or hurt, that is pessimism
    - Societies that bring the most good to the most people, require that people be trusted more than they are distrusted; that they expect more good than harm; they require that people in general have more hope than fear
    - Civilization requires trust; trust requires optimism; civilization requires optimism
- Long termism
    - Humanity progresses by accruing advantages that operate over the long term
    - The best civilizations create things that take generations to build and whose benefits reward not the builders but those who come after them. That is called being a good ancestor.
    - Optimism enables us to reach good and great things beyond the capability of a single generation
- Asymmetric possibilities
    - there are no limits for knowledge or improvement. We’ve encountered nothing we can’t potentially improve
    - Every question answered by science generates at least two new questions, two new territories of unknown things that we now know we don’t know. In this way our ignorance expands faster than our knowledge, which is healthy. Because behind this expansion there is a great asymmetry: what is knowable but still unknown will always be larger than what we already know, meaning there are more possibilities waiting to be discovered than have already been discovered.
    - This asymmetry in knowledge is reason to be optimistic, because it means there are no limits to our improvement. We can always imagine a better way -- and we are also always improving what/who the “we” is
- Deeper currents
    - There are three reasons why people tend to believe things are getting worse rather than better
        - Progress is mostly about what does not happen. Progress means a 92-year-old who did not die today, a boy who was not robbed on his way to school, a 12-year girl who is not married to a 30-year old man, etc. What did not happen does not make the news. The best parts of civilization don’t get headlined.
        - Bad things happen fast, while good things take longer. So when we ask what has happened in the last news cycle (the last five minutes) only fast moving things show up, which are mostly bad news. Good takes longer than a news cycle. So most news, in any media, even responsible ones, is bad news. If newspapers and websites were only updated every 50 years, they might report: literacy is up, longevity increased, violence is down
        - The solutions to most problems will create new problems. But if we can create 1% more solutions than problems, that 1% compounded over decades equals civilization. However 1% of almost anything is invisible in the now, lost in the noise. Such a small differential is really only visible in accumulation and seen in retrospect
    - Optimism is therefore inherently hard to see in real life. It is a deeper current that requires counting things carefully
- Healthy resilience
    - Optimism equips people a greater ability to deal with hardship, and less stress in their lives
    - optimists believe that bad things are produced by temporary causes that can be overcomed, while pessimists believe bad things always happen, and if anything good happens it’s temporary
    - Studies by psychologists show that those who adopt the optimistic assumption are more resilient, better able to adapt and thrive, while the pessimistic struggle more
- Future ingenuity
    - We should be optimistic not because our problems are smaller than we thought, but because our capacity to solve them is larger than we thought

## Particular reasons to be optimistic right now in 2021

- Total Urbanization
    - Today’s widespread middle class living standard is the result of several one-time events for the planet, such as mass migration into cities, the movement of women into the formal working economy, and pervasive automation of labor
    - The first driver of optimism is therefore simply a continuation and completion of the on-going industrial revolution. While modernization has already played out in the developed countries, it has not saturated many developing parts of the world
- Universal Connectivity
    - all adult beings will be connected together
    - This vast connection creates a huge continuous audience, a planet-scale market, and potentially unified global movements
- Sustainable Energy
    - The industrial revolution was fueled by burning a limited supply of easy to get cheap carbon
    - In the coming decades, we will switch to unlimited energy from solar, wind, hydro and nuclear. We can double our energy efficiency simply by decarbonizing the economy
    - In addition to helping with climate change, electrifying everything will yield countless opportunities for business and employment in redesigning transportation, shelter, and civic infrastructure. Since so many of us will live in cities (which increases sustainability), this trend also raises millions of opportunities for the greening (and increased quality) of urban life.
- Accelerated Innovation
    - In addition to the speedups brought by dense urbanity and universal connectivity, new learning tools are accelerating the velocity of innovation,which accelerates prosperity
