# How to Use Price-To-Sales Ratio (P/S) to Value Stocks
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/03/032603.asp)

The price-to-sales ratio utilizes a company's market capitalization and revenue to determine whether the stock is valued properly.

## Formula

$$P/S=\frac{Company's\ Market\ Capitalization}{Total\ Sales}$$

where
- $Company's\ Market\ Capitalization = Number\ of\ outstanding\ shares * Share\ price$
- $Total\ Sales =$ the company's total sales or revenue over the past 12 months

## Understanding the P/S ratio

The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the investment.

The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. All things being equal, a low P/S is good news for investors, while a very high P/S can be a warning sign.

This ratio can be effective in valuing growth stocks that have yet to turn a profit or have suffered a temporary setback.

- in the table above, the companyâ€™s share price increased by 50% over three years while the sales per share rose at a slower pace
- when we look at the P/S ratio, we can see that in Year 1, investors were paying $1.25 per share and in Year 3, they were paying $1.50 for the same share. It essentially means that the investors are paying more for the shares now than they were three years ago

## Limitations of P/S ratio

- The price-to-sales ratio cannot differentiate a leveraged company from an unleveraged one as a company can report a low P/S ratio and can be close to bankruptcy
  - the ratio does not account for the debt on a company's balance sheet
  - a firm with no debt and a low P/S metric is a more attractive investment than a firm with high debt and the same P/S
- The P/S ratio does not provide any information on the profitability 
  - sales dollars cannot always be treated the same way for every company
  - consider construction companies, which have high sales turnover, but (with the exception of building booms) make modest profits. By contrast, a software company can easily generate $4 in net profit for every $10 in sales revenue
