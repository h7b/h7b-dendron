# GitHub Publisher

- GitHub: https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher
- Thoughts:
    - the author of [Obs2mk](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-python) script (deprecated on 2022-11-09) decided to develop a plugin for Obsidian to enhance the publishing experience
    - this plugin send any markdown file to a configured GitHub repository, then deployed via GitHub Pages or Netlify, automated with GitHub Actions
    - one of the most easy methods to [[publish an Obsidian vault using MkDocs|notes.tutorial.mkdocs-publish-obsidian]]
    - has dark theme, built-in navigation bar, search feature. Tags in notes not yet supported. My current 2nd favorite approach.
- [Demo page](https://obsidian-publisher.netlify.app/) is also the documentation of this plugin. It deserves a look which helps me to understand how the notes and folders are organized
