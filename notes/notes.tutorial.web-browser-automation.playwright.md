# [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

Playwright is a testing tool for web application, useful also for web scraping, released on 2021.

Best choice when there's need of a fully rendered browser to scrape a website.

This configuration is more computing power intensive than a simply [[Scrapy|notes.tutorial.python.packages.scrapy]] installation so is used only when a fully rendered browser is needed
