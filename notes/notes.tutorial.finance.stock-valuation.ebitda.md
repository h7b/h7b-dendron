# EBITDA – Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp)

EBITDA is a measure of profitability. EBITDA is also a precise measure of corporate performance since it is able to show earnings before the influence of accounting and financial deductions.

EBITDA exclude
- the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment
- expenses associated with debt by adding back interest expense and taxes to earnings

## Formula

$$EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + Depreciation\&Amortization$$

or

$$EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation\&Amortization$$

## Drawbacks of EBITDA

### EBITDA is a "non-GAAP" measure
Companies tend to spotlight their EBITDA performance when they do not have very impressive (or even positive) net income. It's not always a telltale sign of malicious market trickery, but it can sometimes be used to distract investors from the lack of real profitability.

Companies use depreciation and amortization accounts to expense the cost of property, plants, and equipment, or capital investments. Amortization is often used to expense the cost of software development or other intellectual property. This is one of the reasons that early-stage technology and research companies feature EBITDA when communicating with investors and analysts.

An important red flag for investors to watch is when a company starts to report EBITDA prominently when it hasn't done so in the past. This can happen when companies have borrowed heavily or are experiencing rising capital and development costs. In this circumstance, EBITDA can serve as a distraction for investors and may be misleading.

Hence, using EBITDA as a growth metric can sometimes overshadow a company's actual financial performance and risks.

### EBITDA ignores the cost of assets
EBITDA assumes that profitability is a function of sales and operations alone – almost as if the assets and financing the company needs to survive were a gift.

### EBITDA ignores Working Capital
EBITDA also leaves out the cash required to fund working capital and the replacement of old equipment. For example, a company may be able to sell a product for a profit, but what did it use to acquire the inventory needed to fill its sales channels? In the case of a software company, EBITDA does not recognize the expense of developing the current software versions or upcoming products.

### EBITDA has Varying Starting Points
EBITDA is susceptible to the earnings accounting games found on the income statement. In other words, the earnings figure in EBITDA might be unreliable

### Obscures Company Valuation
EBITDA can make a company look less expensive than it really is. When analysts look at stock price multiples of EBITDA rather than bottom-line earnings, they produce lower multiples. 

In other words, Investors need to consider other price multiples besides EBITDA when assessing a company's value.
