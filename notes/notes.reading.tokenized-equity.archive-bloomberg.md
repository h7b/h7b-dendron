# DeFiChain to Offer Tokenized Versions of Apple, Tesla

ref: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/nasdaq-joins-blockchain-based-tokenized-stock-trading-venture), [archived pdf](https://app.box.com/s/7hi6z447z96iadl1s0rr5u467bhdyljl)

Nasdaq’s feed, along with those of [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/ "Finnhub home page"), will power services on [DeFiChain](https://defichain.com/ "DeFiChain home page"), a native decentralized finance blockchain for the Bitcoin network devoted to monetary applications and services  
DeFiChain will offer tokenized stocks corresponding to the underlying price of listed companies such as Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and GameStop Corp. The tokenized stocks will be collateralized by cryptocurrencies, which means traders won’t have to go through an intermediary such as a broker.  
Tokenized stocks can be purchased in fractions in the form of decentralized loans. This system will power the stock trading mechanics on DeFiChain in a trustless manner and will use DeFiChain’s native digital currency -- DFI -- as well as Bitcoin and USD Coin, among other cryptocurrencies.

**DeFi tokenized stock trading doesn’t offer any ownership of the underlying asset**. Instead, it is a tokenized representation of a stock that, in part, mirrors the underlying asset’s price. It can be traded 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
