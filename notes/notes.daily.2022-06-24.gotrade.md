## Overview

[Gotrade](https://www.heygotrade.com/) is an app that lets international users buy fractional shares of U.S. stocks and ETFs.

The startup was founded in 2019. Its app lets users buy fractional shares in NYSE and Nasdaq-traded stocks starting from $1 USD.

Unlike other investment apps offering CFDs (contract for differences), Gotrade's products are fully backed by listed equities.
- Since Indonesian brokers are not allowed to offer foreign securities within Indonesia, but instead have to offer derivatives of foreign securities, Gotrade partnered with Valbury Asia Futures, the Jakarta Futures Exchange and the Futures Clearing House of Indonesia, which are all overseen by Bappebti, the country’s derivatives regulator, to launch Gotrade Indonesia
- This allows Gotrade Indonesia to offer a fully backed derivative to give its users market access to U.S. stocks. Funds are sent to the Futures Clearing House, and trades are made through Indonesian financial conglomerate Valbury Group and registered on the Jakarta Futures Exchange
- Then trades are sent to the Alpaca Securities LLC, a FINRA licensed broker-dealer in the U.S. and executed at the National Best Bid and Offer to adhere to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulations
- This means that when a user trades on Gotrade Indonesia, it results in a contract between them and Valbury. Valbury’s corresponding trade with Alpaca Securities creates a fully hedged position.

## Fees

Gotrade does not charge commission on trade, custody, inactivity or dividend fees 

Gotrade monetizes by charging a 0.5% to 1.2% foreign exchange fees if users deposit funds in local currency that is converted into U.S. dollars for trading, and interest generated from uninvested cash in brokerage accounts.
