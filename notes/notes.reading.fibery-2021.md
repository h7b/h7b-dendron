two properties to have Product/Market fit:
- Churn rate is relatively low in your target segment. For B2B SaaS it is < 15-20% (annually).
- your users in your target market recommend the product to other people

MRR, activity, number of leads, number of users are not great metrics to measure P/M fit. Let’s say, you can have P/M fit, but have poor marketing and don’t figure out sales channels yet. Or you have a poor conversion, but converted customers don’t churn.
