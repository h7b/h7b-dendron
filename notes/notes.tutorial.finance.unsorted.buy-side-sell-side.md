- `Sell-Side` 
    - is the other side of the financial market, which deals with the creation, promotion, and selling of traded securities to the public
    - On the Sell Side of the capital markets, we have professionals who represent corporations that need to raise money by SELLING securities (hence the name `Sell Side`)
    - The Sell-Side mostly consists of banks, advisory firms, or other firms that facilitate the selling of securities on behalf of their clients
    - Dedicated sell-side analysts can typically dive deeper than buy-side analysts and really learn the ins and outs of an industry
- `Buy-Side` 
    - is the side of the financial market that buys and invests large portions of securities for the purpose of money or fund management
    - On the Buy Side of the capital markets, we have professionals and investors that have money, or capital, to BUY securities
    - These securities can include common shares, preferred shares, bonds, derivatives, or a variety of other products that are issued by the Sell Side
