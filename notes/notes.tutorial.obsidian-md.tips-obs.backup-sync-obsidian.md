# Sync and Backup Obsidian for beginners

ref: [Obsidian Helpl](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/iOS+app), [Obsidian community](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/backup-obsidian-for-beginners/12267/12), [Effective Remote Work](https://effectiveremotework.com/2020/09/obsidian-sync-your-vaults-with-git-github/)

Easiest and priciest way is official [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync), which starts at USD 10/month

## iCloud vs Obsidian Sync
ref: [Licat's message in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/900870622631063552/955855103015919657)

iCloud and Obsidian Sync each has their own unique advantages

Advantages of Obsidian Sync over iCloud for Mac/iOS only users:
- Full end-to-end encryption.
- Ability to ignore some file types (for example, you may have large videos you'd rather not sync to mobile).
- Ability to have some control over configuration and plugins syncing.
- Obsidian can smartly merge conflicts, rather than generating duplicate files.
- Most users find that Obsidian Sync is more reliable than iCloud. As a team of 2 we can't really beat a company with billions, but at least if you run into issues we will actually respond and help investigate.

Advantage of iCloud:
- It's free for most users
- It can sync in the background on iOS (Obsidian can't because sync is implemented as an Obsidian plugin, which only runs when obsidian is open)
- It's generally well established and you may be using it already for other things.
