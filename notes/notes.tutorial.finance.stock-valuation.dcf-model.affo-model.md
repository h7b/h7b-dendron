# Adjusted-Funds-From-Operations (AFFO) 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model
ref: [SimplyWallSt](https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#adjusted-funds-from-operations-discounted-cash-flows-model--how-is-this-calculated=)

Used for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) as these companies incur capital gains and other real estate-specific factors which impacts their free cash flows.

This model is the same as the 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flows Model, except for one key difference â€“ instead of discounting the company's free cash flows, we use its* Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)* instead. AFFO better reflects the operational cash flows of REITs as opposed to the commonly used free cash flows.

*Funds from Operations (FFO)* is the company's earnings, with depreciation and amortization added back on, and removal of capital gains from property sales. AFFO has other adjustments the FFO number to make it even more accurate, by subtracting off capital expenditure and maintenance costs of the property, and adding rental increases. These factors are very specific to property and REITs, making it a far superior measure of value for these types of stocks.
