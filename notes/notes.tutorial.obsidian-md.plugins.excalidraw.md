# Excalidraw

- GitHub: https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin
- Thoughts:
    - The Obsidian-Excalidraw plugin integrates [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), a feature rich sketching tool, into Obsidian
    -  You can store and edit Excalidraw files in your vault, you can embed drawings into your documents, and you can link to documents and other drawings to/and from Excalidraw
