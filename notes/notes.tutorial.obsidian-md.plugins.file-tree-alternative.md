- GitHub: https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative
- Thoughts:
    - allows users to have a different file explorer experience in Obsidian
    - You can see the number of notes under each folder within the folders view
    - You can also focus in and out to a certain folder, which will help you to save space in the folder pane
