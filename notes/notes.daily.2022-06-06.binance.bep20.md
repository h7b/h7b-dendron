# BEP-20

## Overview

[BEP-20](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20) is a token standard on `Binance Smart Chain` (aka BNB Smart Chain) that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage.

BEP-20 was conceived as a technical specification for Binance Smart Chain, with the goal of providing a flexible format for developers to launch a range of different tokens. These could represent anything from shares in a business to dollars stored in a bank vault.

BEP-20 token transfers are fuelled with [[BNB|notes.daily.2022-06-06.binance.bnb]].

[Binance Smart Chain (BSC)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc) is best described as a blockchain that runs in parallel to the Binance Chain. Unlike Binance Chain, BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-ethereum#how-does-ethereum-work). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of Binance Chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem.

## How does Binance Smart Chain work?

Binance Smart Chain achieves ~3s block times with a [Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-blockchain-consensus-algorithm). Specifically, it uses something called `Proof of Staked Authority` (or PoSA), where participants stake BNB to become validators. The supply of BNB decreases over time, as the Binance team regularly conducts [coin burns](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-coin-burn).

`Binance Smart Chain (BSC)` was envisioned as an independent but complementary system to the existing [[Binance Chain|notes.daily.2022-06-06.binance.bep2]].
- Dual-chain architecture is used, with the idea being that users can seamlessly transfer assets from one blockchain to another
- In this way, rapid trading can be enjoyed on Binance Chain, while powerful decentralized apps can be built on BSC.

Because of the flexibility afforded by Binance Smart Chain, assets from a number of different chains can be used in the growing [DeFi](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi) space.
