# Notes from reading

ref: [[notes.reading.five-factor-investing-with-ETF]]

Investing in a company’s stock means purchasing the rights to a portion of that company’s expected future profits. The expected future profits are not guaranteed, so they are purchased at a discount. 

The investment return is the difference between the discounted price paid for the expected profits and the actual profits that accrue to the shares

Expected stock returns are not dictated by the profits that a company generates - they are dictated by the amount that was paid for those profits. Investors will be willing to pay less for riskier future profits and more for safer future profits

In the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model), Risk is described as the measure of sensivity between an asset (or portfolio) and the risk of the overall stock market.

Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) (Fama, 1970)
> In general terms, the ideal is a market in which prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation: that is, a market in which firms can make production-investment decisions, and investors can choose among securities that represent ownership of firms’ activities under the assumption that security prices at any time “fully reflect” all available information. A market in which prices always “fully reflect” available information is called “efficient.”

If the market is efficient then prices contain all relevant information about the expected returns of a stock at that point in time. Price changes will be based on new information, which cannot be predicted reliably. In an efficient market it is not possible to earn reliable excess returns without taking on excess risk. Excess returns without excess risk, known as alpha, is the goal of traditional active management. Active management involves some combination of selecting a subset of stocks and timing the market to generate alpha.

If it is nearly impossible to consistently generate returns in excess of those associated with taking on risk, then it is sensible to minimize costs and maintain long-term exposure to known risks. Index investing using a market capitalization weighted index fund, like the iShares ETF XIC tracking the S&P/TSX Composite index for Canadian stocks, offers low-cost exposure to market risk.

Market beta is market risk as described by the CAPM. The CAPM looks at the measure of sensitivity between an asset or portfolio and the risk of the overall market. A market capitalization weighted equity index fund should have a market beta of 1. A Portfolio consisting of 50% market cap weighted equity index fund and 50% cash should have a market beta of 0.5. If the market goes up 10%, the portfolio with a beta of 1 would be expected to go up 10%, while the portfolio with a beta of 0.5 would be expected to go up 5%.

If two portfolios with the same beta had different returns, the difference in returns could be attributed to the portfolio manager’s ability to select securities and time the market, or to some as-yet unidentified factor. A portfolio that delivers returns higher than expected based on its level of risk is desirable. That excess risk-adjusted return is known as alpha; alpha is the holy grail of investing

Fama and French proposed a five-factor asset pricing model in their 2015 paper A Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model. The five factors include market beta, company size, relative price, gross profitability, and investment.

In order to accomplish factor exposure without making things too complicated we propose a 6 ETF equity portfolio consisting of primarily Canadian listed ETFs. (Read page 25/31, Table 21 - Proposed Five-Factor ETF Model Portfolio)
