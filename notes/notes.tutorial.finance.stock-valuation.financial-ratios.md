Financial ratios are powerful tools to help summarize financial statements and the health of a company.

Financial ratios are typically cast into four categories:
- Profitability ratios
- Liquidity ratios
- Solvency ratios
- Valuation ratios or Multiples

## Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios assess a company's ability to earn profits from its sales or operations, balance sheet assets, or shareholders' equity.

### Key profitability ratios

- Gross margin (and adjusted gross margin)
- Operating margin 
- Net profit margin
- EBITDA margin
- Operating cash flow margin
- Return on assets (ROA)
- [[Return on Equity (ROE)|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.return-on-equity]]
- Return on invested capital (ROIC)
- Return on investment (ROI)

### Understanding profitability ratios

Higher ratio results are often more favorable, but these ratios provide much more information when compared to results of similar companies, the company's own historical performance, or the industry average.

Profitability ratios indicate how efficiently a company generates profit and value for shareholders.

## Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity measures how quickly a company can repay its debts. It also shows how well company assets cover expenses.

### Key liquidity ratios

- [[Quick Ratio|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.quick-ratio]]
- Cash ratio
- Cash conversion cycle (CCC)
- Operating cash flow ratio
- Receivables turnover
- Inventory turnover
- Working capital turnover

### Understanding liquidity ratios

Liquidity ratios give investors an idea of a companyâ€™s operational efficiency. They also show how quickly and easily a company generates cash to purchase additional assets or to repay creditors quickly, either in an emergency situation or in the course of normal business.

## Solvency Ratios

Solvency ratios, also known as leverage ratios, are used by investors to get a picture of how well a company can deal with its long-term financial obligations.

### Popular solvency ratios

- Debt to total assets
- [[Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.debt-equity-ratio]]
- Time interest earned
- Interest coverage ratio
- Net income to liabilities
- Times interest earned

## Valuation Ratios aka Multiples

Valuation ratios, also known as Multiples, are some of the most commonly quoted and easily used ratios for analyzing the attractiveness of an investment in a company.

A multiple measures some aspect of a company's financial well-being, determined by dividing one metric by another metric.
