`Mode`: the one that occurs most frequently. `Mode` is also the only way to calculate an "average" for categorical data

`Median`: postionnally, the one in the middle

`Skew` / skewness: measure the shape of the data distribution. Skew tells to which way the distribution is tilting.  
Skew = tilt of histogram  
- left or negative skew: 
    - the frequency of small numbers is low, and the freq for large numbers is high
    - usually, mean < median
- no skew = bell shape or symmetrical shape
    - mean = median
- right or positive skew:
    - the frequency of small numbers is high, and the freq for large numbers is low
    - usually, mean > median

`Moving Average`: like average of last 7 days. Use to smooth out numbers to give you a better overview of the trend.
