# Note Folder Autorename

- GitHub: https://github.com/pjeby/note-folder-autorename
- Thoughts:
    - This plugin adds only 1 command "Make this note a folder note". It creates a new folder alongside the note with the same name as the note, and then moves that note into of this folder. Then, whenever you move or rename the note, the attached folder will change accordingly.
    - Difference: the [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.folder-note]] plugin changes the UI of the file manager to hide folder notes and pretend that the folder is itself a note. In contrast, this plugin doesn't do any special styling or change the behavior of file manager. It just silently monitors the vault activity and steps in to keep your paths and filenames consistent.
