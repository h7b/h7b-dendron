# Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitaladequacyratio.asp)

The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is a measurement of a bank's available capital expressed as a percentage of a bank's risk-weighted credit exposures.

CAR is critical to ensure that banks have enough cushion to absorb a reasonable amount of losses before they become insolvent.

CAR is used by regulators to determine capital adequacy for banks and to run stress tests.

Two types of capital are measured with CAR. 
- Tier-1 capital can absorb a reasonable amount of loss without forcing the bank to stop its trading,
- while tier-2 capital can sustain a loss if there's a liquidation

The downside of using CAR is that it doesn't account for the risk of a potential run on the bank, or what would happen in a financial crisis.

## Calculation

$$CAR = \frac{Tier\ 1\ Capital + Tier\ 2\ Capital}{Risk\ Weighted\ Assets}$$

where
- $Tier\ 1\ Capital$, or core capital, consists of equity capital, ordinary share capital, intangible assets and audited revenue reserves. 
    - Tier-1 capital is used to absorb losses and does not require a bank to cease operations
    - Tier-1 capital is the capital that is permanently and easily available to cushion losses suffered by a bank without it being required to stop operating
    - A good example of a bankâ€™s tier one capital is its ordinary share capital
- $Tier\ 2\ Capital$, comprises unaudited retained earnings, unaudited reserves and general loss reserves
    - This capital absorbs losses in the event of a company winding up or liquidating
    - Tier-2 capital is the one that cushions losses in case the bank is winding up, so it provides a lesser degree of protection to depositors and creditors
    - It is used to absorb losses if a bank loses all its Tier-1 capital
- $Risk\ Weighted\ Assets$ are calculated by looking at a bank's loans, evaluating the risk and then assigning a weight
    - Risk-weighted assets are used to determine the minimum amount of capital that must be held by banks and other institutions to reduce the risk of insolvency
    - The capital requirement is based on a risk assessment for each type of bank asset. For example, a loan that is secured by a letter of credit is considered to be riskier and requires more capital than a mortgage loan that is secured with collateral
