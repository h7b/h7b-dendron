# How can I buy native assets to pay for blockchain gas fees?

ref: [1inch](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/4585055-how-can-i-buy-native-assets-to-pay-for-blockchain-gas-fees)

Native assets can be purchased in several different ways:
- "Buy ETH" located at the top of the 1inch desktop site. This will take you to the 1inch 3rd party payment processor, MoonPay, where you can purchase ETH with a credit/debit card.
- Buy ETH or other assets directly within the 1inch Mobile Wallet
- You can purchase ETH at any major centralized exchange, like FTX, Coinbase, or Binance.
