## Product summary

- This ETF offers exposure to short term government bonds, focusing on Treasury bonds that mature in one to three years
- VGSH is a safe haven appeal as an asset that avoids both credit risk and interest rate risk
- VGSH probably doesnâ€™t have much appeal as a core holding, since the overlap with broad-based funds such as BND will be significant
- This ETF can be a useful tool for tilting exposure towards Treasury bonds with a bias towards the shorter end of the maturity spectrum, decreasing the effective duration of a portfolio and minimizing overall volatility
- Other options offering similar exposure include SHY and TUZ
