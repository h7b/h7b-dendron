## Notes from reading

### PM interview process
1.  **Recruiter phone screen \[30 minutes, optional\]:** Make sure the candidate meets the minimum requirements for the role and is likely to be a fit for the organization. Focus on their expectations for the role, basic skill questions, personality fit (e.g. [not an asshole](https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving-ebook/dp/B000OT8GV2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)), and their interview timelines. About 50% of candidates should make it through this step.
    
2.  **Hiring manager phone screen \[30 minutes\]:** Make sure there is a strong chance that the candidate is a fit for the role. Focus on getting to know the person as a human, the role, and a couple skills or attributes that you believe to be most important to this role (more on this below). About 40% to 50% of candidates should make it through this step.
    
3.  **A full-day interview \[4-5 hours\]:** The day is made up of two parts:
    
    1.  **A project** (done at home before arriving, in the office, or live), sharing what they came up with, with a group of potential colleagues
        
    2.  **Three to six 1:1 interviews** with potential colleagues, each testing for a key PM skill
        
4.  **Post-interview panel discussion \[30-60 minutes\]:** Each interviewer blind votes Strong No, No, Yes, or Strong Yes. Share your vote, discuss, and then the hiring manager makes a decision.
    
5.  **Reference checks:** Ping their references (and backchannel) to make sure you aren’t missing anything.
    
6.  **Make an offer:** Put together a compelling offer, share it with them, and try like hell to get them to accept.

### What interview questions to ask

here’s a sampling:

-   **Collaboration:** Tell me about a time you disagreed with an engineer on your team and how you resolved it.
    
-   **Execution:** Pick a project you’re proud of that took 3-9 months. Walk me through it from beginning to end. I’ll ask questions along the way. \[Give this ~7-10 minutes\]
    
-   **Strategy:** Pick a product you worked on in the past year—talk me through your strategy for it.
    
-   **Customer insights:** Tell me about a time you did user research on a product/feature and that research had a big impact on the product.
    
-   **Impact:** What’s the most important or impactful product you shipped? What made it so important or impactful? Would it have been as impactful without you, and why?
    
-   **Product sense:** How would you improve feature x in our product?
