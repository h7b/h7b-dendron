# Return on Equity (ROE)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp)

Return on equity (ROE) is the measure of a company's net income divided by its shareholders' equity.

ROE is a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits.

## Formula

$$Return\ on\ Equity=\frac{Net\ Income}{Average\ Shareholders'\ Equity}$$

where
- $Net\ Income$ is found on the income statement
- $Shareholders'\ equity$ comes from the balance sheet

## What Does Return on Equity Tell You?

Whether an ROE is deemed good or bad will depend on what is normal among a stock’s peers.

A good rule of thumb is to target an ROE that is equal to or just above the average for the company's sector—those in the same business. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the past few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo’s management is above average at using the company’s assets to create profits.

## Limitations of Return on Equity

### Inconsistent Profits
Imagine that a company, LossCo, has been unprofitable for several years. Each year’s losses are recorded on the balance sheet in the equity portion as a “retained loss.” These losses are a negative value and reduce shareholders' equity.

Now, assume that LossCo has had a windfall in the most recent year and has returned to profitability. The denominator in the ROE calculation is now very small after many years of losses, which makes its ROE misleadingly high.

### Excess Debt
If a company has been borrowing aggressively, it can increase ROE because equity is equal to assets minus debt. The more debt a company has, the lower equity can fall. A common scenario is when a company borrows large amounts of debt to buy back its own stock.
