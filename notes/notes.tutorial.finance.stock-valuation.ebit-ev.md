# EBIT/EV Multiple
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit-ev-multiple.asp), [ValueSignals](https://www.valuesignals.com/Glossary/Details/Earnings_Yield)

The EBIT/EV multiple, shorthand for [[earnings before interest and taxes|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.ebit]] (EBIT) divided by [[enterprise value|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.entreprise-value]] (EV), is a financial ratio used to measure a company's "earnings yield".

The concept of the EBIT/EV multiple as a proxy for earnings yield and value was introduced by Joel Greenblatt.

Investors and analysts use the EBIT/EV multiple to understand how earnings yield translates into a company's value.

The higher the EBIT/EV multiple, the better for the investor as this indicates the company has low debt levels and higher amounts of cash.

## Formula

$$EBIT/EV=\frac{EBIT}{EV}$$

## Interpretation

EBIT/EV is supposed to be an earnings yield, so the higher the multiple, the better for an investor. There is an implicit bias toward companies with lower levels of debt and higher amounts of cash. A company with a leveraged balance sheet, all else being equal, is riskier than a company with less leverage. The company with modest amounts of debt and/or greater cash holdings will have a smaller EV, which would produce a higher earnings yield.

## Benefits of the EBIT/EV Multiple
- employing EBIT as a measure of profitability, as opposed to net income (NI), eliminates the potentially distorting effects of differences in tax rates
- using EBIT/EV normalizes for effects of different capital structures

The earnings yield is also useful in producing a metric when a company has zero or negative earnings. Because such a case is common among hi-tech, high-growth, or startup companies, EPS will be negative producing an undefined P/E ratio (denoted as N/A).

## Downside of the EBIT/EV Multiple
- the EBIT/EV ratio does not normalize for depreciation and amortization costs. Thus, there are still potential distorting effects when companies use different methods of accounting for fixed assets
