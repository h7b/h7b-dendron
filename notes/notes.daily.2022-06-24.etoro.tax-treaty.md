# Can I reduce the tax that is deducted from my dividends?

Since 1 September 2022, eToro has started offering Tax Treaty Benefits for residents of some countries who receive dividends from US stocks and ETFs. The tax rate varies according to the treaty agreed by each country. These rates will change if and when the corresponding tax treaty is modified.

These benefits apply to BUY (long) positions on US stocks and ETFs. They are currently available for eToro personal investment accounts and not for corporate accounts.

To access tax treaty benefits, you must have signed the W-8BEN form and entered your Tax Identification Number (or equivalent) in your eToro investment account.

If your country (Vietnam) is not listed, this means that there are no tax treaty benefits and the withholding rate remains 30%.
