# Types of Derivatives

Derivatives fall into two general classifications: forward commitments and contingent claims.

The factor that distinguishes forward commitments from contingent claims is that 
- forward commitments **obligate the parties to engage** in a transaction at a future date on terms agreed upon in advance, 
- whereas contingent claims provide one party the **right but not the obligation to engage** in a future transaction on terms agreed upon in advance
