# Obsidian - Tips and Experiences

## Thoughts

In Obsidian apps, When I modify
- name of notes (md files)
- location of notes (md files, folder structure, file path)
- tags name
all of these elements will also be updated:
- the references link between notes
- tags in note

According to their [Terms of Service](https://obsidian.md/terms), the legal business name of Obsidian is Dynalist Inc. incorporated in Canada and their services are subjected to the laws or jurisdiction of Canada.
