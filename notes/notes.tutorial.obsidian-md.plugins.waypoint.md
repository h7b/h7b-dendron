# Waypoint

- GitHub: https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint
- Thoughts:
    - this plugin is used for creating index. It automatically generates the file tree of a folder. Once a waypoint is generated, it'll automatically link to every note within the folder and its subfolders. The Waypoint plugin will detect when you create/rename/move/delete a note and automatically stay up-to-date
    - since waypoints can only be generated in folder notes, it is highly recommended that you install a plugin like [[Folder Note|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.folder-note]] to ensure that folder notes don't get lost after folder renames and other actions that change the file tree. If a folder note containing a waypoint is renamed to something other than the folder's name, the waypoint will no longer be updated.
