# Tools to edit markdown files

Beside of any text editor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which can edit markdown files easily, but lack WYSIWYG, there are some other apps to do this task

[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)  
An in-browser markdown editor, with sync scrolling, mermaid diagram support, katex, publish online to GitHub or html, import/export features, WYSIWYG.

[Mark Text](https://marktext.app/)  
An Electron app, with WYSIWYG. But slow 1st open time, and heavy (500 MB install folder size).

[Bangle.io](https://bangle.io/)  
This is a powerful yet simple note taking web app that works on top of your locally saved Markdown files.  
Support backlink, tags, folder view, search.  
It is a competitor of [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
