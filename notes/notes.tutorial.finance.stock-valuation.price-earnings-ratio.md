The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS)

In essence, the price-to-earnings ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive $1 of that company’s earnings. This is why the P/E is sometimes referred to as the `price multiple` because it shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. If a company was currently trading at a P/E multiple of 20x, the interpretation is that an investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of current earnings.

Simply put, a P/E ratio of 15 would mean that the current market value of the company is equal to 15 times its annual earnings. Put literally, if you were to hypothetically buy 100% of the company’s shares, it would take 15 years for you to earn back your initial investment through the company’s ongoing profits.

## Formula

$$P/E=\frac{Market\ Palue\ per\ Share}{Earnings\ per\ Share}$$

where the [[earnings per share (EPS)|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.earnings-per-share]] has many variants:
- Time variants:
    - EPS in most recent financial year (current)
    - TTM is a Wall Street acronym for "trailing twelve months". This number signals the company's performance over the past 12 months
    - EPS expected in next fiscal year (forward), found in a company's earnings release. This is the company's best-educated guess of what it expects to earn in the future
- Primary or diluted
- Measured using different accounting rules 

$$Forward\ P/E=\frac{Current\ share\ price}{Estimated\ Future\ Earnings\ per\ share}$$

$$Trailing\ P/E=\frac{Current\ share\ price}{Trailing\ 12-Month\ Earnings\ per\ share}$$

## Understanding the P/E Ratio

A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is overvalued, or else that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.

Analysts like to think of the P/E ratio as a price tag on earnings. It is used to calculate a relative value based on a company's level of earnings. In theory, $1 of earnings at company A is worth the same as $1 of earnings at company B. If this is the case, both companies should also be trading at the same price, but this is rarely the case.

If company A is trading for $5, and company B is trading for $10, this implies that the market values company B's earnings more. There can be various interpretations as to why company B is valued more. It could mean that company B's earnings are overvalued. It could also mean that company B deserves a premium on the value of its earnings due to superior management and a better business model.

Two kinds of P/E ratios—forward and trailing P/E—are used in practice.

### Forward Price-to-Earnings
Forward P/E uses projected EPS, it is prone to miscalculation and/or the bias of analysts.

This forward-looking indicator is useful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings will look like, without changes and other accounting adjustments.

### Trailing Price-to-Earnings
Trailing P/E relies on past performance.

Trailing P/E is the most popular P/E metric because it's the most objective.

However, trailing P/E also has its share of shortcomings
- a company’s past performance does not signal future behavior. Investors should thus commit money based on future earnings power, not the past. 
- The fact that the EPS number remains constant while the stock prices fluctuate is also a problem. If a major company event drives the stock price significantly higher or lower, the trailing P/E will be less reflective of those changes.
