# Perspective

[Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective/) is an interactive analytics and data visualization component, which is especially well-suited for large and/or streaming datasets.

Perspective makes it simple to build user-configurable analytics entirely in the browser, or in concert with Python and [Jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
