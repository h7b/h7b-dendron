# Ordinary Dividends

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp)

Dividends are considered *ordinary* by default, unless they meet specific criteria put in place by the IRS to be classified as *[[qualified|notes.reading.tax-investors-us.qualified-dividend]]*.

The tax rate you pay on ordinary dividend earnings is at the same level as taxes for regular federal income or wages.

Companies that pay these earnings to stockholders on record report all aggregate ordinary dividends in box 1 of Form 1099-DIV.

For tax filings, you will list these earnings on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040, Schedule B, Line 9a.
