# Apps to Take Time-Stamped Notes on YouTube and Learning Courses

ref: [makeuseof](https://www.makeuseof.com/time-stamped-notes-youtube-learning-courses/)

When you're watching a video online, these free apps take time-stamped notes to remember the exact point where you needed to highlight something.

## [TubersLab](https://www.tuberslab.com/)

Available as extension on Chrome, Firefox and mobile apps (iOS/Android).

It works only with YouTube.

Features:
- Start typing at any point to automatically pause the video and create a time-stamped note. Once you press the period key to end your sentence, the video will automatically resume
- Press the period key to create a time-stamp with no notes, without pausing the video
- Press Ctrl to take a time-stamped screenshot of your video
- generate a PDF with all the screenshots and annotations
- Export your notes to Notion, Readwise, Obsidian.

My thoughts:
- This is my current choice
- Cannot delete tags
- Can delete notes, and note's contents
- Only 1.8MB, which is lighter than Yinote (27MB)

## [YiNote](https://yinote.co/)

Available as extension on Chrome, Firefox.

It works with any HTML5 video (e.g. Coursera, Lynda, Youtube, LinkedIn, Vimeo)

Features:
- automatically takes a screenshot of every note you write
- annotate the screenshots
- generate a PDF with all the screenshots and annotations
- Export your notes to Evernote, Google Docs, or OneNote.

My thoughts:
- The current issues with Chrome. Yinote modal page cannot be closed (reported issues [112](https://github.com/shuowu/yi-note/issues/112), [106](https://github.com/shuowu/yi-note/issues/106))
- Tested and not satisfied
