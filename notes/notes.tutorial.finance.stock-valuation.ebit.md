# Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp)

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an indicator of a company's profitability.

EBIT is also known as operating income.

EBIT is used to analyze the performance of a company's core operations without the costs of the capital structure and tax expenses impacting profit.

## Formula

$$EBIT = Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses$$

or

$$EBIT = Net Income + Interest + Taxes$$

where $COGS$ = Cost of goods sold

## Understanding EBIT

EBIT measures the profit a company generates from its operations making it synonymous with operating profit.

By ignoring taxes and interest expense, EBIT focuses solely on a company's ability to generate earnings from operations, ignoring variables such as the tax burden and capital structure

EBIT is helpful when investors are comparing two companies in the same industry but with different tax rates

EBIT is helpful in analyzing companies that are in capital-intensive industries, meaning the companies have a significant amount of fixed assets on their balance sheets.
- Fixed assets are physical property, plant, and equipment and are typically financed by debt.
- As a result, capital-intensive industries have high-interest expenses due to a large amount of debt on their balance sheets

## Issues of EBIT

### EBIT is not a GAAP​ metric

There are different ways to calculate EBIT, and so is not usually labeled specifically as EBIT in financial statements (it may be reported as operating profits in a company's income statement)

### Interest expense is excluded in the EBIT

Companies with a large amount of debt will likely have a high amount of interest expense. EBIT removes the interest expense and thus inflates a company's earnings potential. Not including debt in the analysis can be problematic if the company increases its debt due to a lack of cash flow or poor sales performance.
