# Practice

Apply the basic investing framework from the book [[notes.daily.2022-11-07.little-book-that-still-beats-the-market]] into an experiment to pick stock in HOSE.

Access to the practicing sheets at [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sa36QYcEv1ItEwJausWV8PSqUvFbnGSXhzD1xKCBajs/edit?usp=sharing). The current setup is as follows.
- investing universe: 17 stocks, each has market cap > 30k billion VND
- `PE_score` column: 1 for lowest PE, 17 for highest
- `ROA_score` column: 1 for highest ROA, 17 for lowest
- `Investment_rating` column: sum of `PE_score` and `ROA_score`, then sort by ascending order. The most favorable stock has the smallest score.
