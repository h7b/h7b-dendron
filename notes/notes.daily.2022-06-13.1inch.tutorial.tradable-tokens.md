As a decentralized exchange aggregator, 1inch Network provides a place to swap any Ethereum (ERC-20), BNB Chain (BEP-20), Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom or Gnosis / xDAI network token at the cheapest rates possible. 

If you don't see the token in the drop-down menu of the swapping window, it can be [manually added](https://help.1inch.exchange/en/articles/4585116-what-to-do-if-i-cannot-find-a-token-i-want-to-trade-in-the-drop-down-menu) with its contract address (the suggested source for finding the contract is [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en))
