# Obsidian Plugin: Convert a URL into markdown

- GitHub: https://github.com/trashhalo/obsidian-extract-url
- Thoughts:
    - Extract the content of a URL to Markdown format if the website allows it
    - If your system has [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) installed, extra details like channel name and description will be extracted for Youtube urls
    - Support extracting urls from clipboard on mobile
    - If you archive an url of GitHub repo, the plugin will pull down the readme for later reference (see [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bm83DPFA-Q))
