# The four kinds of documentation

ref: [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/eu/2017/the-four-kinds-of-documentation-and-why-you-need-to-understand-what-they-are-daniele-procida/)

there are four distinct kinds of documentation - with four distinct functions
- learning-oriented tutorials
- goal-oriented how-to guides
- understanding-oriented discussions
- information-oriented reference material

Structuring documentation according to its four distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain.
