# Obsidian Advanced URI

- GitHub: https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri
- Thoughts:
    - this plugin controls different features in Obsidian just by opening some URIs
    - I use this plugin to assign a [unique ID to each note](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/concepts/file_identifiers#key-in-frontmatter) and use this UID as parameter of URI to be opened by other software
        - Why UID instead of relying on filename as default?
        - There is a situation where I want to rename the file but the link to it must be retained.
