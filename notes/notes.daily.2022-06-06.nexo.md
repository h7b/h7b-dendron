## Overview

[Nexo](https://nexo.io/) is an online loan platform that allows you to obtain financing in return for putting up a security deposit.

Your security deposit will come in the form of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In return, you’ll be able to borrow an amount that is proportionate to the size of your security. Crucially, Nexo allows you to borrow funds in real-world money. Think along the lines of USD, EUR, and GBP.

A further selling point to using the Nexo platform is that you can liquidate your cryptocurrency holdings without needing to sell them. In other words, as long as you always meet your repayments, you’ll get the exact amount of cryptocurrency back once the loan has been repaid in full. This will help you to avoid a taxable event.

## How Much can I Borrow at Nexo?

Nexo uses a [Loan-to-Value (LTV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp) system when determining how much you can borrow.

This means that the size of your credit line will be based on the amount that you are prepared to put up as a security deposit. However, the specific LTV ratio will also depend on the type of cryptocurrency that you deposit.

Current LTV ratios listed by Nexo on 2022:
- Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): 50% LTV
- Ripple (XRP): 40% LTV
- Stablecoins: 90% LTV
- Nexo: 15% LTV
- Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS: 30% LTV
- Stellar Lumens (XLM): 17% LTV

For example, let’s say that you are willing to put 2 BTC up as security
- If the current market value of Bitcoin was $10,000, this amounts to a total holding of $20,000
- As such, Nexo would allow you to borrow $10,000 against your 2 BTC security deposit.

## Fees

When you purchase crypto with Visa and Mastercard debit or credit card on the Nexo Exchange, Standard fee will be applied to the “Pay With” amount specified: 1.49% for EU and 3.49% for non-EU countries. Depending on your card issuer's policy, they may charge additional fees for online card purchases and currency conversion. These fees are independent of Nexo’s fee.

Depending on your [Loyalty tier](https://support.nexo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360017445559-Nexo-Loyalty-Program-Explained), you will also receive between 1 and 5 monthly crypto withdrawals to an external wallet that are feeless. Once the free withdrawal limit is reached, you will be automatically charged a fee incurred by the network. The fee is not fixed and depends on the current condition of the respective blockchain. You will see the amount required for the processing of your transaction before submitting the withdrawal.

The counter for free crypto withdrawals will reset on the first day of each month, after which you can make another set of free withdrawals.
