# What really happens when babies are left to cry it out?

## Notes

each child has their own needs and responses. Iâ€™ve never found a single method that works universally in any aspect of parenting.

A little baby just doesn't want to be alone. I discovered just sitting in the same room, reading something on my tablet was enough to fall a sleep after like 20 minutes, 90% of the time. A kid is not a robot, you can't expect it to go asleep when you say it's time for bed, there's no on/off button.

Kids are all energy machines. Starve the machine of energy, or use it all up, and the machine will go idle.
