# [iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG)](https://etfdb.com/etf/AGG/#etf-ticker-profile)

## Overview

- Expense Ratio: 0.03%
- Inception: 2003-09-22
- NAV as of 2022-05-05: $101.57
- Index tracked: [Bloomberg US Aggregate](https://etfdb.com/index/bloomberg-us-aggregate/)

### Analyst report

- Many may find the significant allocations to MBS and Treasuries somewhat insufficient for their return objectives; increased corporate bond exposure through LQD may result in a better balance and more attractive return
- AGG is unmatched in terms of liquidity, but investors can achieve similar exposure at a lower cost
- BND and LAG both seek to replicate the same benchmark but charge lower expense ratios
- For investors looking to avoid compounding costs and tracking error, the broad-based BND may be a better option for U.S. fixed income exposure
