Website: https://www.timescale.com/

TimescaleDB is a time-series database, built on top of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). TimescaleDB is an open-source relational database for time-series data. It uses full SQL and is just as easy to use as a traditional relational database, yet scales in ways previously reserved for NoSQL databases.

You can deploy TimescaleDB
- on Timescale Cloud. [Pricing](https://www.timescale.com/products/#Pricing) starts at USD 24/month.
- or self-hosted for free
