# How to sideload apps to iPhones?

When referring to iOS apps, "sideloading" means installing an app in IPA format onto an Apple device, usually through the use of a computer program such as Cydia Impactor, Xcode, on the actual device using a jailbreak method or using a signing service instead of through Apple's App Store.[^1]

[^1]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading#:~:text=When%20referring%20to%20iOS%20apps,of%20through%20Apple%27s%20App%20Store.)

## Free

Use [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/).

I'm experimenting Sideloadly with a free Apple developer account.

Pros:
- Can install apps that are not available on Apple's App Store, such as: [uYouPlus](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus), [CercubePlus](https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus), [NineAnimator](https://github.com/SuperMarcus/NineAnimator), [Wolf-for-Facebook a.k.a Facebook Wolf](https://github.com/ipahost/Wolf-for-Facebook), [Spotify++](https://appdb.to/app/cydia/1900000540), [PlexTweak](https://appdb.to/app/cydia/1900000472)

Cons:
- Apps sideloaded with Sideloady, using free Apple developer account, are subjected to the 7-day signing restrictions. However, the signing lasts longer (1 year) if you have a [paid Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/) (USD 99/year)

## Paid services

If purchasing a paid Apple developer account is quite steep, redditors also recommend some 3rd-party UDID Signing services to consider.
- [Signtunes](https://signtunes.co/): USD 12/year
- [Signulous](https://www.signulous.com/): [USD 20/year](https://www.signulous.com/register)
- [UDID Registrations](https://www.udidregistrations.com/): [USD 10-20/year](https://www.udidregistrations.com/buy)
- [Signum](https://signum.fun/): [GBP 12-18/year](https://signum.fun/purchase/)
