# Current Account Savings Account (CASA)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/current-account-savings-account.asp)

Current Account Savings Accounts (CASA) are a type of non-term deposit account.

A CASA has a lower interest rate than term deposits, such as a certificate of deposit, and is thus a cheaper source of funds for the financial institution.

## Current Account Savings Account Ratio

$$CASA\ Ratio = \frac{CASA\ Deposits}{Total\ Deposits}$$

A higher ratio means a larger portion of a bank’s deposits are in current and savings accounts, rather than term deposit accounts. 
- This is beneficial to a bank because it gets money at a lower cost. 
- Therefore, the CASA ratio is an indicator of the expense to raise funds and, therefore, is a reflection of a bank’s profitability or likelihood of generating profit.
