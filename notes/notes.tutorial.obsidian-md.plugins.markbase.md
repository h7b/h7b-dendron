- Thoughts:
    - plugin to publish notes on [Markbase](https://www.markbase.xyz/Home)
    - [Pricing] starts at USD 9/month. Free to publish with subdomain `*.markbase.xyz`
    - Pro: 
        - has graph notes, top-left navbar, right-side table of contents
        - simple publishing workflow, don't need to configure GitHub or Netlify, just copy-paste the markbase token into markbase plugin
    - Cons:
        - custom domain and full text search feature are hidden behind paywall
