# Obsidian QuickShare

- GitHub: https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare
- Thoughts:
    - plugin to share temporarily your Obsidian notes on [Noteshare.space](https://noteshare.space/) for free
    - Noteshare.space is a service for sharing encrypted Markdown notes from Obsidian. Notes are end-to-end-encrypted and are only stored temporarily. Or you can also self-host Noteshare, though it's not easy [^1]
    - Requires no account or external API keys
    - similar to [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.obsius]], this plugin offers a simple method to share one note to public but not suitable for publishing a whole vault or a folder of multiple notes
