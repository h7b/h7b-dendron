# Electricity Market

ref: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_market)

In economic terms, electricity is a commodity capable of being bought, sold, and traded. An electricity market, also power exchange or PX, is a system enabling purchases, through bids to buy; sales, through offers to sell. Bids and offers use supply and demand principles to set the price. Long-term contracts are similar to power purchase agreements and generally considered private bi-lateral transactions between counterparties.

The commodities within an electric market generally consist of two types: power and energy. 
- Power is the metered net electrical transfer rate at any given moment and is measured in megawatts (MW). 
- Energy is electricity that flows through a metered point for a given period and is measured in megawatt hours (MWh).

The underlying concepts of market designs are:
- separate the potentially competitive functions of generation and retail from the natural monopoly functions of transmission and distribution
- establish a wholesale electricity market and a retail electricity market
The role of the wholesale market is to allow trading between generators, retailers and other financial intermediaries both for short-term delivery of electricity and for future delivery periods.

## Wholesale electricity market
A wholesale electricity market exists when competing generators offer their electricity output to retailers. The retailers then re-price the electricity and take it to market

Buying wholesale electricity is not without its drawbacks (market uncertainty, membership costs, set up fees, collateral investment, and organization costs, as electricity would need to be bought on a daily basis), however, the larger the end user's electrical load, the greater the benefit and incentive to make the switch.

For an economically efficient electricity wholesale market to flourish it is essential that a number of criteria are met, namely the existence of a coordinated spot market that has "bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices". These criteria have been largely adopted in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.

## Retail electricity market
A retail electricity market exists when end-use customers can choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods.

Common functions that an electricity retailer has to be able to perform:
- Billing
- Credit control
- Customer management via an efficient call centre
- Distribution use-of-system contract
- Reconciliation agreement
- "Pool" or "spot market" purchase agreement
- Hedge contracts â€“ contracts for differences to manage "spot price" risk

Competitive retail needs open access to distribution and transmission wires. This in turn requires that prices must be set for both these services. They must also provide appropriate returns to the owners of the wires and encourage efficient location of power plants. There are two types of fees:
- The access fee covers the cost of having and accessing the network of wires available, or the right to use the existing transmission and distribution network. 
- The regular fee reflects the marginal cost of transferring electricity through the existing network of wires.
