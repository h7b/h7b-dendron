# Inline Scripts - Obsidian Plugin

- GitHub: https://github.com/jon-heard/obsidian-inline-scripts
- Thoughts:
    - This plugin allows me to type text shortcuts which will trigger a script (javascript). Then this script generates text to replace the previously typed text shortcuts
    - This plugin works on both desktop and mobile version of Obsidian
    - I can easily use [[Espanso|notes.tutorial.text-expander]] on desktop, but this plugin will be useful if I need to use a text expander in Obsidian on mobile
    - text shortcuts are defined in shortcut-files, which are added to the vault as markdown notes
- Examples
    - Typing `;;date;` can cause the text to expand into `6/7/2021`
