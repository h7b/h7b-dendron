# Quick Ratio
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp)

The `Quick Ratio` (aka `acid test ratio`) is an indicator of a companyâ€™s short-term liquidity position. It measures a company's capacity to pay its [[Current Liabilities|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-liabilities]] without needing to sell its inventory or obtain additional financing.

An "acid test" is a slang term for a quick test designed to produce instant results.

## Formula

$$Quick\ Ratio = \frac{Liquid\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}$$

where
- $Liquid\ Assets$ are [[Current Assets|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-assets]] that can be quickly converted into cash with minimal impact on the price received in the open market
  - $Liquid\ Assets = Cash + Marketable\ Securities + Accounts\ Receivable$
  - $Liquid\ Assets = Current\ Assets - Inventory - Prepaid\ Expenses$
- [[Current Liabilities|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-liabilities]]

## Understanding Quick Ratio

The higher the ratio result, the better a company's liquidity and financial health; the lower the ratio, the more likely the company will struggle with paying debts.

A company that has a quick ratio of less than 1 may not be able to fully pay off its current liabilities in the short term, while a company having a quick ratio higher than 1 can instantly get rid of its current liabilities.

## Quick Ratio vs Current Ratio

Analysts prefer to use the acid-test ratio rather than the [[Current Ratio|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-ratio]] (aka the Working Capital Ratio) because the acid-test method ignores assets such as inventory, which may be difficult to quickly liquidate.

- If the acid-test ratio is much lower than the current ratio, it means that a company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory. 
- On the other hand, a very high ratio could indicate that accumulated cash is sitting idle
