# How to link daily notes in Obsidian

ref: [dannyhatcher](https://dannyhatcher.com/how-to-link-daily-notes-in-obsidian/)

Situation: I want to create a date trails on the top of each daily note.

This approach is achieved by automatically hard-code the date trails on the creation of each daily note. It does not dynamically determine whether the yesterday or tomorrow's note is created or not.

The concept is that I apply a template on the creation of daily notes, using the plugin [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.templater]].
