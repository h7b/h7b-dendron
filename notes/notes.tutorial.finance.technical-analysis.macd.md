# Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.

MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [[exponential moving average (EMA)|notes.tutorial.finance.technical-analysis.ma.ema]] from the 12-period EMA.

MACD helps investors understand whether the bullish or bearish movement in the price is strengthening or weakening.

MACD triggers technical signals when it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line.

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD's baseline. If the MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD's baseline. Traders use the MACD's histogram to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high.
