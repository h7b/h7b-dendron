# [Obsidian List Modified](https://github.com/franciskafieh/obsidian-list-modified)

- Thoughts:
    - When a file is modified, the plugin checks if there is already a link to this modified file in your daily note. If so, it doesn't need to link it again. Otherwise, if this modified file meets the predefined criteria, the plugin appends a link to the daily note
