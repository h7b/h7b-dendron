# Dividend Discount Model
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/ddm.asp)

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The DDM is based on the theory that the value of a company is the present worth of the sum of all of its future dividend payments.

DDM is a variant of [[DCF model|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.dcf-model]], called an equity discounted cash flow model.

## Formula
Mathetically, 

$$Value\ of\ Stock = \frac{EDPS}{CCE-DGR}$$

where
- $EDPS =$ Expected Dividend per Share
- $CCE =$ Cost of Capital Equity
- $DGR =$ Dividend Growth Rate

### Gordon growth model (GGM)
The most common and straightforward variant of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is known as the [Gordon growth model (GGM)]((https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp))

The GGM assumes that a company exists forever and that there is a constant growth in dividends when valuing a company's stock.

$$P = \frac{D_0*(1+g)}{r-g} = \frac{D_1}{r-g}$$

where
- $P =$ current stock Price
- $D_0 =$ the most recent dividend
- $D_1 =$ value of next year's dividend (after $D_0$)
- $r =$ constant Cost of Capital Equity for the company, or rate of return
- $g =$ constant Growth rate expected for dividends, in perpetuity

## Shortcomings of the DDM
- The model assumes a constant dividend growth rate in perpetuity
  - DDM may not be the best model to value newer companies that have fluctuating dividend growth rates or no dividend at all
- The second issue with the DDM is that the output is very sensitive to the inputs
- The model also fails when companies may have a lower rate of return (r) compared to the dividend growth rate (g). This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings
