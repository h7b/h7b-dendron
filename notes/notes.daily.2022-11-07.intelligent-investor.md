## Notes

From [the summary video by The Swedish Investor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npoyc_X5zO8). Length: 14min.

[01:40](https://youtu.be/npoyc_X5zO8?t=100): Market is not always rational, the underlying value of a business can differ from the price Market is willing to pay for it. The market tends to be over-optimistic or too pessimistic. Don't let this influence what you think the true value of your assets are. Instead, see it as a business opportunity, where you get to deal with a person who has no idea of what he's doing.
