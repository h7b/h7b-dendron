# How do I view tabs on browsers?

Inspired by this [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32312441) on Hacker News. I used to have a window of browser with 50 opened tabs, which slowed my PC down. This problem leads me to the path of using tab management extensions.

## Current best choice

[OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/)
- I've been using it since 5 years
- Pros: 
    - Simple one click to close all active tabs and save to OneTab list
    - Share a collection of stored tabs from OneTab
    - Can import/export URLs as plain text files
- Cons:
    - Cannot sync OneTab list between devices or browsers
    - Lost data due to OneTab crash with more than 2k tabs archived
    - Don't have a proper method to back up / restore data from OneTab

## My other epxeriences

[Tablerone](https://tabler.one/)
- An alternative of [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/)
- Pros:
    - one click to close all active tabs and save to Tablerone list
    - introduce workspaces concept, tags
    - Share a collection of stored tabs from Tablerone. Can set a timer to self-destroy the published link
    - Take notes on urls
    - [Import, Export, and Backup Data](https://tabler.one/help-and-support/import-export-backup-data/)
- Cons:
    - Cannot sync Tablerone list between devices or browsers
    - I'm not comfortable with the UI 
        - It wastes so much spaces on left and right side. The preview thumbnail is quite intrusive and useless for me, since I find that it's sufficient to recall info with tab's title
        - If a session stored more than 5 urls, only the first five are displayed and the others are hidden under a "Show all" button

[Tab Session Manager](https://github.com/sienori/Tab-Session-Manager)
- An alternative of [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/)
- Pros:
    - supports automatic saving
    - assign tags for each session
    - Import / Export sessions
    - Backup Data
    - Cloud sync: save sessions to Google Drive and sync with other computers
- Cons:
    - I'm not comfortable with the UX. Don't have the behavior of one click to close all active tabs and save that session

[Keptab](https://keptab.com/)
- a copy of [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/)
- According to an [article](https://blog.keptab.com/introducing-project-keptab.html) from their blog, they claimed better than OneTab since Keptab never lose data when browser goes crashed
- Cons:
    - Exactly the same experiences as OneTab. But Keptab does not have the sharing feature. I tested and turned back to OneTab since I've collected only 700 tabs in average in OneTab for each browser

[Tree Style Tab](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab)
- This extension works only on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)
- Its alternatives on Chromium are: [Forest](https://getforest.io/), [Tree Style Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tree-style-tab/oicakdoenlelpjnkoljnaakdofplkgnd?hl=en)
- Tab-Tree is aimed to solve a very simple but annoying problem, that is, how to switch to the tab you want quickly if your window opened lots of tabs. This tree separates all tabs into different groups by the relationship between the child-tab and their parent-tab, which gives you a better insight for all the tabs. All the tabs opened by same tab will become the children of the tab which opens them.
