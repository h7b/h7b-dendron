# Simple Moving Average (SMA)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp)

Simple moving averages is simply the sum of the stock's closing prices during a time period, divided by the number of observations for that period.

A simple moving average smooths out volatility and makes it easier to view the price trend of a security.

## Formula

$$SMA=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n P_i}{n}$$

where:
- $P_i=$ the price of an asset at period $i$
- $n=$ the number of periods

Example: A 10-day moving average would average out the closing prices for the first 10 days as the first data point. The next data point would drop the earliest price, add the price on day 11, then take the average, and so on. Likewise, a 50-day moving average would accumulate enough data to average 50 consecutive days of data on a rolling basis.

## What Does the Simple Moving Average Tell You?

Quickly determine if an asset is in an uptrend or downtrend.

Another popular analytical use is to compare a pair of simple moving averages with each covering different time frames.
- If a shorter-term simple moving average is above a longer-term average, an uptrend is expected
- if the long-term average is above a shorter-term average then a downtrend might be the expected outcome.

Example:
- A [death cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp) occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA. This signals a long-term bear market going forward
    - Notice: the death cross only tells you that price action has deteriorated over a period a little longer than two months, if the crossing is done by the 50-day moving average

- A [golden cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp) occurs when daily 50-day SMA crossover up through the 200-day SMA. This signals a long-term bull market going forward

**Notice:** These convinced of the pattern's predictive power note the death cross preceded all the severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. This is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the select data points helpful to the argued point. Cherry picking those bear-market years ignores the many more numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction.
