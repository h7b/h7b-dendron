ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Agreement)

The WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) is a tariff liberalization agreement agreed in 1996 through a *Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products*.

It requires each participant to bind and eliminate customs duties for all products specified in the Agreement, and the tariff elimination is implemented on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis.

The ITA covers a large number of high technology products, including computers, telecommunication equipment, semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing and testing equipment, software, scientific instruments, and their parts and accessories.
