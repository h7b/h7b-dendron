`pyenv` is a python interpreter installation manager. It allows you to install and manage multiple python installations, on the same machine.

## Setup

See the [pyenv documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) for installation methods.

With pyenv installed, you can install any python version that you would like. Depending on which directory youâ€™re in, pyenv will point to your specified python version.

Some example of commands

```python
# See all available python installations.
pyenv install --list

# Install some python versions.
pyenv install  3.7.5
pyenv install  2.7.17
pyenv install  3.8.0

# See all python installations that you have installed.
pyenv versions

# Set the default/global from one of the python versions.
pyenv global 3.8.0

# In the current directory, set the python version. This creates the file .python-version.
pyenv local 2.7.17

# To see which python is currently being used.
pyenv version
```
