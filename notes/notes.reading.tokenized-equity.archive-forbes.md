# Billionaire Bitcoin Investor Explains Why Tokenized Stocks Are A Big Deal...Outside America

ref: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2021/05/11/the-future-of-tokenized-stockswhat-they-can-replace-and-what-to-watch-out-for/), [archived pdf](https://app.box.com/s/cy26dd6413ugydlbuw1xvv0uccxucm4a)

Outside of the United States, in many countries, investors don’t have easy access to U.S. securities markets or, if they do, it is a costly proposition.

Depending on the exchange, tokenized stock may or may not have collateral behind it. 
- The tokenized stock without collateral is a synthetic security that the crypto exchange or intermediary writes into existence on a blockchain somewhere. 
    - This matters because if that ‘somewhere’ is in Minsk, Ukraine or some remote tiny island. Investors may not have much recourse if the service provider hurts investors. 
    - Crypto exchanges offering tokenized stocks without collateral include Currency.com and others.
- crypto exchanges with collateralized stock tokens, such as: FTX, Binance, and Bittrex Global.

There are other important nuances for would-be investors, such as whether or not owning a tokenized stock gives you ownership rights to get paid stock dividends and be able to vote as a shareholder. For example, Binance states on its website that “holding stock tokens does not transfer any shareholder rights to you” whereas FTX and Bittrex report being committed on a ‘best-efforts’ basis to see tokenized stock holders receive stock dividends.

**So, what exactly does one own when clicking ‘buy’ for these novel tokenized stocks?**

The short answer is you own a collateralized digital derivative product that can be traded much like the spot instrument, i.e. the share or ‘real thing’.A derivative security references its value from a separate security that trades in the cash market. Both the derivative and spot instrument can generate profits and losses in lockstep in someone’s trading account.

**The Demise of CFDs?**

One way to understand the significance of collateralized asset issuance is to compare it to what it might be replacing. One of the potentially disruptive qualities of tokenized securities is that they [could](https://financefeeds.com/are-tokenized-stocks-a-new-threat-to-the-fx-cfd-industry/ "https://financefeeds.com/are-tokenized-stocks-a-new-threat-to-the-fx-cfd-industry/") steamroll the large retail FX and Contract for Difference (CFD) industry, which is well established and generally offers tradable instruments that are not saved to a blockchain. Broadly speaking, CFD brokers also lag crypto exchanges in terms of crypto sophistication and product depth. For example, CFD’s - which are not available in the United States - have long let users trade a synthetic instrument mimicking Apple or Microsoft stock prices, but are, at heart, IOUs issued by a retail broker, not traded on exchange, and non-transferable. The adaptability of well capitalized CFD retail brokerage firms such as IG, CMC Markets, and Plus500 should not be underestimated, however.

**Tokenized Stocks Trading Conditions**

While on the surface a tokenized Apple stock is traded in multiple exchanges, you should know that any tokenized stocks can only be traded in one crypto exchange. For example, AAPL/USD is the ticker name in the FTX platform, while Binance uses the AAPL/BUSD ticker, and Currency.com the AAPL.cx ticker. Try to transfer your AAPL/BUSD or AAPL.cx securities to FTX and you will be informed that the stock token is not portable to other crypto exchanges or to your local brokerage firm where you have your securities portfolio. “It would be really powerful to be able to freely move tokenized stocks on the blockchain, but as of now FTX and \[German financial services firm\] CM-Equity do not support that. They remain on FTX, a tied agent to CM-Equity,” indicated FTX’s Bankman-Fried.

Best case scenario, investors trade with ease the tokenized stock at any time without a glitch. Worst case scenario, the value of the investment resides digitally at a firm that may not offer the service tomorrow or could be at risk if the other intermediary firms went out of business. In the U.S. stock owners are protected from the risk that a brokerage firm is put out of business by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a non-profit run by U.S.-based registered broker-dealers. To our knowledge, no such protection exists in the world of tokenized stocks, in part because this type of security is so new.

**Collateralization 101: A Tokenized Stock Is Born**

The collateralized tokenized stocks hitting the market are mainly originating from two European firms working together in different capacities to serve various crypto exchanges. CM-Equity AG describes itself as a “fully-licensed capital markets infrastructure platform” and acts as brokers to the crypto exchanges. A separate company in this financial engineering, Swiss-based Digital Assets AG describes itself as a “boutique firm focused on the issuance of tokenized financial products.”

 **FTX tokenized stock generation process**

The client owns the COIN token issued by Digital Assets AG and custodied by FTX. FTX specifies in its website that, at the users’ discretion, CM-Equity can honor a redemption of the spot token for the actual share of stock. By contrast, Binance, states that stock tokens are “generally redeemable from the issuer” and that a special redemption fee may apply and that the redemption is “generally settled in stablecoin”.

**What is Counterparty Risk in Owning This Type of Security?**

Counterparty risk is the non-compliance risk in a transaction, such as between an investor and the brokerage firm or exchange holding a security on behalf of the investor. It doesn’t occur often, but at times brokerage firms and crypto exchanges may cease doing business. The tokenized stocks a client may hold could be unreachable or unusable outside of the issuing party, even if written to a blockchain.

There are numerous risks associated with stock tokens, including 
- not being able to redeem the digital token
- significant adverse price slippage for trading during illiquid hours
- or not being able to receive a fair treatment related to corporate actions.
