## Overview

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA; French: Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, ASFC) is a federal law enforcement agency that is responsible for border control (i.e. protection and surveillance), immigration enforcement, and customs services in Canada.

The CBSA is responsible to Parliament through the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, currently Marco Mendicino, who took office following the 2021 election, and is under the direction of the president of the Canada Border Services Agency, John Ossowski.

The Agency was created on December 12, 2003, by an order-in-council that amalgamated the customs function of the now-defunct Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the enforcement function of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (now known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada), and the port-of-entry examination function of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

The agency is responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security and public safety priorities and facilitate the free flow of persons and goods, including animals and plants, that meet all requirements under the program legislation.

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) provides clearance, control and examination services, on behalf of other government departments and agencies, for travellers, importers and exporters, at close to 1,200 points of entry (POE), including land border offices, international mail processing centres, airports, sufferance warehouses, and a number of other service locations.
