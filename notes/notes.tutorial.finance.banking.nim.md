# Net Interest Margin (NIM)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061715/what-net-interest-margin-typical-bank.asp)

Net interest margin (NIM) reveals the amount of money that a bank is earning in interest on loans compared to the amount it is paying in interest on deposits.

NIM is one indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.

The average NIM for U.S. banks was 3.3% in 2018.

## Calculation

NIM is calculated as a percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets during a specified period.

For example, a bank's average interest-earning assets (which generally includes, loans and investment securities) was $100 million in a year, which generated $5.5 million in interest income. In the same year, the bank paid $2.5 million in interest expense to its depositors.

Then The bank's net interest margin can be calculated using the following formula: net interest margin = ($5.5 million - $2.5 million) / $100 million = 3%.
