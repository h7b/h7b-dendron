## Notes from reading

you don't want things to be densely connected or loosely separated
- if things are densely connected, different parts of the system will be overwhelmed by information that is irrelevant to their functioning, which will make them worse at what their function is
-  if things are loosely separated, different parts of the system can't access information which is relevant and necessary for their functioning
- ref: discussion in Dendron [discord](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/918900151861538906/918909988318109716)

By partitioning, you have zones which are more densely interconnected to themselves than other zones, but still have communicative linkages with other zones
