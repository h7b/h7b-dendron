# How To Pick an ETF
Ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-choose-best.asp)

## Key Takeaways

-   As an investor, buying ETFs can be a smart and low-cost strategy to build an optimal portfolio.

## Narrowing a Wide Selection of ETFs

The wide array of choices in the ETFs space exist. These include traditional index ETFs based on U.S. and international [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) indexes and [subindexes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subindex.asp), but also those that track benchmark indices in [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), and [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp). There are ETFs based on [investing style](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstyle.asp) (value, growth, or a combination thereof) and that segregate by [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp). You will also find leveraged ETFs that provide multiples in return (or loss) based on the underlying index's movements, or inverse ETFs that rise when the market falls and vice-versa.

## Picking the Right ETF

Given the bewildering number of ETF choices that investors now have to contend with, it's important to consider the following factors:

-   **Level of Assets:** To be considered a viable investment choice, an ETF should have a minimum level of assets, a common threshold being at least **$10 million**. An ETF with assets below this threshold is likely to have a limited degree of investor interest. As with a stock, limited investor interest translates into poor [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and wide [spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp).
-   **Trading Activity**: An investor needs to check if the ETF that is being considered trades in sufficient volume on a daily basis. Trading volume in the most popular ETFs runs into millions of shares daily; on the other hand, some ETFs barely trade at all. Trading volume is an excellent indicator of liquidity, regardless of the asset class. Generally speaking, the higher the trading volume for an ETF, the more liquid it is likely to be and the tighter the bid-ask spread. These are especially important considerations when it is time to exit the ETF.
-   **Underlying Index or Asset**: Consider the underlying [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) or [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) on which the ETF is based. From the point of view of [diversification](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp), it may be preferable to invest in an ETF that is based on a broad, widely followed index, rather than an obscure index that has a narrow industry or geographic focus.
-   **Tracking Error**: While most ETFs track their underlying indexes closely, some do not track them as closely as they should. All else being equal, an ETF with minimal [tracking error](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trackingerror.asp) is preferable to one with a greater degree of error.
-   **Market Position**: "[First-mover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firstmover.asp) advantage" is important in the ETF world, because the first ETF issuer for a particular sector has a decent probability of garnering the lion's share of assets, before others jump on the bandwagon. It is therefore prudent to avoid ETFs that are mere imitations of an original idea, because they may not differentiate themselves from their rivals and attract investors' assets.

## In Case of ETF Liquidations

The closing, or liquidation, of an ETF is usually an orderly process. The ETF issuer will notify investors, generally three to four weeks in advance, about the date when the ETF will stop trading. That said, an investor with a position in an ETF that is being liquidated still has to decide on the best course of action in order to protect his or her investment. Essentially, the investor has to make one of the following choices:

-   **Sell the ETF shares before the "stop trading" date**: This is a proactive approach that may be suitable in cases where the investor believes that there is a significant risk of a substantial near-term decline in the ETF. In such cases, the investor may be willing to overlook the wide [bid-ask spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) that are likely to be prevalent for the ETF, due to its limited liquidity.
-   **Hold on to the ETF shares until liquidation**: This alternative may be suitable if the ETF is invested in a sector that is not volatile and the [downside risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp) is minimal. The investor may have to wait a couple of weeks for the issuer to complete the process of selling the securities held within the ETF, and distributing the [net proceeds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netproceeds.asp) after expenses. Holding on for the liquidated value eliminates the issue of the bid-ask spread.

Regardless of the course of action, the investor will have to contend with the issue of taxes arising from the liquidation of the ETF investment. For example, if the ETF was held in a taxable account, the investor will be responsible for paying taxes on any [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp).

## The Bottom Line

When selecting an ETF, investors should consider factors such as its level of assets, trading volume and underlying index. In the event that an ETF is to be liquidated, an investor has to decide whether to sell the ETF shares before it stops trading or wait until the liquidation process is completed, with due consideration given to the tax aspects of the ETF sale.
