Summary:
- Define your investing universe (list of companies that you have interest in). For example 10 companies in VN30
- Rank them by 2 conditions 
    - `low PE` (1 for lowest PE, 10 for highest) and 
    - `high ROA` (1 for highest ROA, 10 for lowest)
- Sort their scores by ASC order since you want the total score as low as possible
- then invest in the top 5 companies of this sorted list.
