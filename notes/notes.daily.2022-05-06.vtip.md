### Analyst report

- The Vanguard Short-Term Inflation Protected Securities ETF tracks an index of inflation-protected securities backed by the U.S. government
- The fund invests in debt with a remaining maturity of less than five years
- The mix of short- and medium-term duration also gives the fund some protection against rising interest rates, which tend to put a larger dent in the value of longer-dated Treasuries
- VTIP may be a good choice for investors who want the safety of U.S.-backed government debt, but are also worried that a sudden surge in inflation will drag down the value of longer-dated Treasuries
