# How Gear Ratios Work

## Bicycle transmissions

- Cycling cadence
    - it's the number of crank revolutions per minute (often recorded as rpm - revolutions per minute), which is how fast we can pedal
    - This value should, most often, be in the range of 70-100 rpm
- Gear ratio
    - The power of our legs on single-speed bikes is transmitted via the chain and bicycle sprockets - the front (called a chainring) and rear (cog)
    - By dividing the number of teeth (or the diameter of sprocket) of the former by the latter, we get the gear ratio value, which is responsible for how many times the wheel turns during one turn of the crank
    - the higher the ratio, the harder it’ll be for us to accelerate and the lower the cadence we’ll get. However, it'll be much easier for us to maintain high speeds
    - A higher gear ratio is good when you need more acceleration to cruise your vehicle, whereas a lower gear ratio provides more torque to get the vehicle moving from a resting position
    - The primary purpose of the gear ratio is to reduce the torque by increasing the speed, and vice versa
- Bicycle external drivetrain with a front and rear derailleur
    - Gears are changed on the cassette (a set of sprockets on the rear wheel) by the rear derailleur
