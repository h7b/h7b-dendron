# SQLite Vs PostgreSQL

SQLite and PostgreSQL are among the most widely used relational database management systems (RDMS). They are both open-source and free.

Principle
- SQLite: Ultra-lightweight in setup, administration, and required resource
- PostgreSQL: The worldâ€™s most advanced open source database.

SQLite is a self-contained, file-based, a.k.a. an "embedded" database which means it's server-less and can run within your app.

PostgreSQL on the other hand works based on a client-server model which requires a DB server to set up and run over the network.

Supported Data Types
- SQLite supports only five types: BLOB, NULL, INTEGER, TEXT, REAL
- PostgreSQL supports almost everything that you can think of.
