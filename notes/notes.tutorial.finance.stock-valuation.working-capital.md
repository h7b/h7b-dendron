# What Is Working Capital?
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp)

Working Capital, also called Net Working Capital, represents the difference between a company’s [[Current Assets|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-assets]] and [[Current Liabilities|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-liabilities]].

## Formula

$$Working\ Capital = Current\ Assets - Current\ Liabilities$$

## Understanding Working Capital

Net Working Capital (NWC) is a measure of a company’s liquidity and short-term financial health.
- Positive NWC indicates that a company can fund its current operations and invest in future activities and growth.
- High NWC isn’t always a good thing. It might indicate that the business has too much inventory or is not investing its excess cash.

NWC that is in line with or higher than the industry average for a company of comparable size is generally considered acceptable. Low NWC may indicate a risk of distress or default.

NWC is important because it is necessary for businesses to remain solvent. In theory, a business could become bankrupt even if it is profitable. After all, a business cannot rely on paper profits to pay its bills—those bills need to be paid in cash readily in hand.
