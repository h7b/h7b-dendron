# Obsidian Calculator (aka Meld Calc)

- GitHub: https://github.com/meld-cp/obsidian-calc
- Thoughts:
    - evaluate math expressions and insert the result into your notes
    - have to run command `Meld Calc: Evaluate` manually on the current selection through `command palette` to execute calculations
    - If you need to change inputs and update output, you have to clear the output before running command again
    - results of calculations are written in the markdown file
    - alternatives: [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.mathpad]], [[notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.numerals]]
