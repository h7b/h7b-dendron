# Derivatives

## Introduction

Equity, fixed-income, currency, and commodity markets are facilities for trading the basic assets of an economy. 
- Equity and fixed- income securities are claims on the assets of a company. 
- Currencies are the monetary units issued by a government or central bank. 
- Commodities are natural resources, such as oil or gold. 
- These underlying assets are said to trade in **cash markets** or **spot markets** and their prices are sometimes referred to as **cash prices** or **spot prices**, though we usually just refer to them as stock prices, bond prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices.

A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its performance from the performance of an underlying asset. 
- The so-called "underlying asset" is often simply referred to as the underlying, whose value is the source of risk

Derivatives are similar to insurance in that both allow for the transfer of risk from one party to another.
- like insurance, derivatives pay off on the basis of a source of risk
- like insurance, derivatives have a definite life span and expire on a specified date

Derivatives are issued on equities, fixed- income securities, interest rates, currencies, commodities, credit, and a variety of such diverse underlyings as weather, electricity, and disaster claims.

Derivatives are created in the form of legal contracts. They involve two parties—the buyer and the seller (sometimes known as the writer)—each of whom agrees to do something for the other, either now or later. 
- The buyer, who purchases the derivative, is referred to as the **long** or the holder because he owns (holds) the derivative and holds a long position 
- The seller is referred to as the **short** because he holds a short position

There are two general classes of derivatives
- **forward commitments**: provide the ability to lock in a price at which one might buy or sell the underlying. They force the two parties to transact in the future at a previously agreed-on price. The various types of forward commitments are called forward contracts, futures contracts, and swaps
- **contingent claims**: provide the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a pre-determined price. The choice of buying or selling versus doing nothing depends on a particular random (contingent) outcome. The primary contingent claim is called an **option**

Derivatives generally trade at lower transaction costs than comparable spot market transactions, are often more liquid than their underlyings, and offer a simple, effective, and low-cost way to transfer risk.

**Risk management** is the process by which an organization or individual defines the level of risk it wishes to take, measures the level of risk it is taking, and adjusts the latter to equal the former. 
- Risk management never offers a guarantee that large losses will not occur, and it does not eliminate the possibility of total failure
- Risk management is a dynamic and ongoing process, reflecting the fact that the risk assumed can be difficult to measure and is constantly changing

Derivatives facilitate the transfer of risk, enable the creation of strategies and payoffs not otherwise possible with spot assets, provide information about the spot market, offer lower transaction costs, reduce the amount of capital required, are easier than the underlyings to go short, and improve the efficiency of spot markets.

Derivatives are typically priced by forming a hedge involving the underlying asset and a derivative such that the combination must pay the risk-free rate and do so for only one derivative price.

Derivatives pricing relies heavily on the principle of storage, meaning the ability to hold or store the underlying asset. Storage can incur costs but can also generate cash, such as dividends and interest.
