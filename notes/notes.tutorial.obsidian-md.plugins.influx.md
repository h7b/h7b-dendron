# Obsidian Influx

- GitHub: https://github.com/jensmtg/influx
- Thoughts:
    - A plugin for Obsidian that aggregates a terse stream of backlinked clippings in the footer of notes
    - Intended usage pattern:
        - Information should mainly be written in daily (or Zettelkasten-ish) notes. Topical notes will then mainly be aggregates of clippings from daily notes
        - Notes should be taken hierarchically, in the form of bullet lists/bullet journaling. This helps keep clippings terse and relevant
        - Links should be used as the only organizing principle in the vault - forgo use of tags and files/folders. This helps with completeness; the plugin only considers links when aggregating
    - I have no idea what's the use case. I put it here simply because it is beautiful
