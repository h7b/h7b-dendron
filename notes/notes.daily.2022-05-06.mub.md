### Analyst report

- The fund started tracking the ICE AMT-Free US National Municipal Index in September 2021, moving from its original index, the S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index [^1]
    - Both indexes target investment-grade municipal bonds that are exempt from federal income tax and Alternative Minimum Tax
    - There's not much difference between the two indexes' construction, aside from a decrease in the minimum outstanding amount required 
    - The ICE AMT-Free US National Municipal Index requires bonds have a minimum face value of $15 million, compared with $25 million for its prior bogy. This widens the fund's scope
    - The new index includes around 23,000 bonds, versus 13,000 for its prior benchmark
