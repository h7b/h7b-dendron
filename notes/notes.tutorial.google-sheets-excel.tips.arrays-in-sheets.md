# Using arrays in Google Sheets
ref: [Google](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6208276?hl=en)

An array is a table (consisting of rows and columns) of values

You can create your own arrays in a formula in your spreadsheet by using brackets `{ }`

The brackets allow you to group together values, while you use the following punctuation to determine which order the values are displayed in:
- `Commas`:   
    Separate columns to help you write a row of data in an array.   
    For example, ={1, 2} would place the number 1 in the first cell and the number 2 in the cell to the right in a new column.
- `Semicolons`:  
    Separate rows to help you write a column of data in an array.  
    For example, ={1; 2} would place the number 1 in the first cell and the number 2 in the cell below in a new row.
