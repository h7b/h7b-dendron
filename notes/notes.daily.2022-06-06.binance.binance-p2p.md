# [Binance P2P Trading](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/c-66?navId=66#67)

Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is a form of trading where a buyer and seller directly exchange their crypto and fiat assets with the help of an online marketplace and escrow services.

When a buyer has paid the seller, and the seller has confirmed that the payment is received, the seller has to confirm and release the crypto to the buyer.

Since P2P and spot markets are 2 separate sections, you have to [transfer](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360034585131) your crypto from the P2P wallet (aka Funding Wallet) to the spot wallet in order to trade in the market. You need to do inversely if you want to trade in P2P.
