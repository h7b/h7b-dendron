# [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/overview/)

[Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver) is a web application testing suite used also for web scraping.

[[Playwright|notes.tutorial.web-browser-automation.playwright]] is preferred to Selenium Webdriver, as it has a more similar behaviour to a real user, easier to install and configure.
