## Overview

PAX Gold (PAXG) is a digital asset. Each token is backed by one fine troy ounce (t oz) of a 400 oz London Good Delivery gold bar, stored in Brink’s vaults. If you own PAXG, you own the underlying physical gold, held in custody by Paxos Trust Company.

Since PAXG represents physical gold, its value is tied directly to the real-time market value of that physical gold. The amount of gold representing the total supply of PAXG is a 1:1 ratio – one fine troy ounce of gold equals one PAXG token.

PAXG gives customers the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of physical bars. You can redeem the token for physical gold at any time. PAX gold also allows token holders to redeem their tokens for gold even if Paxos were to go bankrupt.

The issuance of PAXG is approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

The minimum purchasable amount on the Paxos platform is 0.01 PAXG.

## Fees

Paxos charges fees (from 0.15% to 1%, 0.02 PAXG minimum fee) for both the creation and redemption of the PAXG token, whenever you buy or sell PAXG from your Paxos account, on either the wallet or PAX Gold pages. Fee schedule is calculated based on PAXG tokens; USD is included in this [chart](https://paxos.com/paxgold/) as an estimate for reference only.
