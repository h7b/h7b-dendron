# Online presence plan for SMB

case study: Save Water Tech SARL, [tax-number](https://www.societe.com/societe/save-water-technology-878866755.html)

## Current situation
The company's owner has only a domain name: `savewatertech.fr`

He needs to build the company's digital identity and boost its online presence

Problems:
- **Critical**: the domain will be expired in 6 days on 2021-11-12
    - check: [whois](https://whois.domaintools.com/savewatertech.fr)
- **Important**: don’t have online identity
- **Normal**: lack of brand awareness on internet

## Action plan
### Stage 1: Do It Now
estimated time: 10 min

Renew domain name before 2021-11-12. You have only 6 days left to keep it. Or you need to prepare a new domain name for your company

### Stage 2: Plan and build ASAP
estimated time: 5 days - 2 weeks

Secteur d'activité: services de nettoyage,  services relatifs aux bâtiments et aménagement paysager

Build a landing page for company with 5 targets:
- mobile friendly
- short loading time
- has blog feature
- has ecommerce feature (?) or just marketing site (?)
- is not too complicated for non-tech person to build and maintain

Question: Do you need to make a website with ecommerce functionality or just a marketing site?

marketing site cost USD 15/month
- check [Typedream Pricing](https://typedream.com/pricing)

ecommerce site cost USD 29/month
- check [Plans & pricing | Webflow](https://webflow.com/pricing)
    - some premium themes for ecommerce:
        - [Mood - Small Business HTML5 Responsive Website Template (webflow.com)](https://webflow.com/templates/html/mood-small-business-website-template) - USD 70
        - [TrailNation - Retail HTML5 Responsive Website Template (webflow.com)](https://webflow.com/templates/html/trailnation-retail-website-template)  - USD 70
        - [Shopkeeper X - Retail HTML5 Responsive Website Template (webflow.com)](https://webflow.com/templates/html/shopkeeper-x-retail-website-template)  - USD 129

    - Shopify premium themes start at USD 250

### Measuring success of your digital marketing process
implement Google Analytics or any other analytic tools (like [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/))

6 metrics:
- **Visitors:** Knowing who is coming to visit your site, how long they then spend on the site, and which pages they are looking at before leaving
- **Sessions**: This signifies the visitors that have spent any time on your website
- **Average session duration**: You need to know that people are exploring your site and spending some quality time reading content. If your average session is under 30 seconds, then you know you need to add more relevant and engaging content to your site
- **Bounce rate**: Bounce rate is the measurement of people who stay on your website for a short amount of time (30s). If you have a high bounce rate of 80%, it means that people have visited your website for 30 seconds or less and then navigated to another website.
- **New visitors**: It is important to ensure that your audience is growing consistently and that new people are visiting your website. Having a fine balance between returning visitors and brand new visitors is important
- **Acquisition**: or traffic sources. It is important to know where your traffic is coming from. Having a healthy balance of search, referral and direct traffic is good for your business.
