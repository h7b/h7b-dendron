### Analyst report

- The investment thesis behind small caps is that these firms are likely to provide strong growth prospects to a portfolio and should have a much easier time growing than their large cap counterparts. However, these securities are extremely volatile and can experience large losses or gains in a very short period of time
- Despite their volatility, these products should probably be in every investors' portfolio as they tend to move somewhat independently of large caps and can be a better "pure play" on the American economy
