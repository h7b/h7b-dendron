# Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

ref: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator)

## General

The MBTI was constructed by two Americans: Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, who were inspired by the book Psychological Types by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.

It is a questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign a value to each of four categories: 
- Introversion (Hướng nội) or Extraversion (Hướng ngoại), 
- Sensing (Cảm giác) or Intuition (Trực giác), 
- Thinking (Suy nghĩ) or Feeling (Cảm nhận ), and
- Judging (Phán đoán) or Perceiving (Nhận thức). 

One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, such as "INTP".

Though the MBTI resembles some psychological theories, it has been criticized as pseudoscience and is not widely endorsed by academic researchers in the psychology field. [^7] The indicator exhibits significant scientific (psychometric) deficiencies, including poor validity, poor reliability, measuring categories that are not independent, and not being comprehensive. [^8]

The test has been described as one of many self-discovery "fads" and has been likened to horoscopes / [[numerology|notes.daily.2022-11-16.numerology]], as both rely on the [Barnum effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect), flattery, and confirmation bias, leading participants to personally identify with descriptions that are somewhat desirable, vague, and widely applicable.

The test-retest reliability of the MBTI tends to be low. Large numbers of people (between 39% and 76% of respondents) obtain different type classifications when retaking the indicator after only five weeks. [^8]

At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, MBTI testing became highly popular among young Koreans who were using it in an attempt to find compatible dating partners. The craze led to a rise in MBTI-themed products including beers and computer games.[114] One survey reported that by December 2021, half the population had taken a test.[^115]

## My thoughts

I tried the 2 versions in Vietnamese
