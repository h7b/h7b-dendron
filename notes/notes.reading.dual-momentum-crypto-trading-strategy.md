## Notes from reading

`Dual momentum` is a well-known investment strategy within the [academic](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2042750) and [investment](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2018/05/02/accelerating-dual-momentum-investing/) communities.

With the so-called `dual momentum crypto strategy`, they try to rationalize their investment decision by
- filtering the coinsâ€™ price returns over a period of time
- then calculate the momentum score of each filtered coin to get a decision

This strategy essentially trades and rebalances monthly.
