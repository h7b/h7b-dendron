# H-model

Fuller and Hsia (1984) developed H-model, a variant of the two- stage model in which growth begins at a high rate and declines linearly throughout the supernormal growth period until it reaches a normal rate at the end.

The value of the dividend stream in H-model is the combination of
- the present value of the companyâ€™s dividend stream if it were to grow at $g_L$ forever
- and an approximation of the extra value (assuming $g_S > g_L$) accruing to the stock because of its supernormal growth for Years $1$ through $2H$

$$V_0 = \frac{D_0(1+g_L)}{r-g_L} + \frac{D_0H(g_S-g_L)}{r-g_L}$$

where:
- $V_0=$ value per share at $t=0$
- $D_0=$ current dividend
- $r=$ required rate of return on equity
- $H=$ half-life in years of the high-growth period (i.e., high-growth period $=2H$)
- $g_S=$ initial short-term dividend growth rate
- $g_L=$ normal long-term dividend growth rate after year $2H$
