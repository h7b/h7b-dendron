# Operating Cash Flow (OCF)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp), [CFI](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/operating-cash-flow/)

Operating cash flow (OCF) is a measure of the amount of cash generated by a company's main business activities within a specific time period.

OCF indicates whether a company can generate sufficient positive cash flow to maintain and grow its operations.
- If a company is not bringing in enough money from its core business operations, it will need to find temporary sources of external funding through external financing or capital expansion. However, this is unsustainable in the long run. 
- Therefore, operating cash flow is an important figure to assess the financial stability of a company's operations.

## How to Present Operating Cash Flow

Operating cash flows concentrate on cash inflows and outflows related to a company's main business activities, such as selling and purchasing inventory, providing services, and paying salaries. Any investing and financing transactions are excluded from the operating cash flows section and reported separately, such as borrowing, buying capital equipment, and making dividend payments.

### [Indirect Method](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indirect_method.asp)

The indirect method begins with Net Income from the bottom of the Income Statement then adds back non-cash items (such as depreciation, accounts receivable, and accounts payable) and adjusts for changes in [[net working capital|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.working-capital]], to arrive at the total cash generated or consumed in the period.

$$Operating\ Cash\ Flow = Operating\ Income + Non-Cash\ Expenses - Increase\ in\ Working\ Capital$$

Example:
- Net Income is used as the starting point
- All non-cash items are “added back”, meaning any accruals are reversed, including:
  - Depreciation
  - Stock-based compensation is not paid out with actual cash, but instead with the issuance of shares
  - Other expense/income could include various items such as unrealized gains or losses or accrued items
  - Deferred taxes arise from the difference between accounting methods companies use when filing their taxes vs those needed for filing their financial statements
- Change in [[Working Capital|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.working-capital]] (operating assets and liabilities) adjustments include:
  - When inventory on the balance sheet goes up, it results in a reduction of cash
  - When accounts receivable increases, it also creates a reduction of cash, as it means a portion of the revenues recorded have not yet been paid by customers
  - When accounts payable, accrued expenses, and unearned revenue increase, they cause an increase in cash

### [Direct Method](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct_method.asp)

The direct method tracks all transactions in a period on a cash basis and uses actual cash inflows and outflows on the cash flow statement.

Example:

The difficulty and time required to list all the cash disbursements and receipts—required for the direct method—makes the indirect method a preferred and more commonly used practice. Further, companies that use accrual accounting do not also collect and store transactional information per customer or supplier on a cash basis.
