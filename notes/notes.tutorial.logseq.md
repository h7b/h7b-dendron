    - an article explaining three dilemmas that beginner will experience with Logseq in their first try which are
        - why should I use daily journal
        - tags, hierarchy, page-tags, which one should I use
        - one graph for everything or multiple graphs. This is similar to the question should I use one vault or multiple vault in Dendron or Obsidian
