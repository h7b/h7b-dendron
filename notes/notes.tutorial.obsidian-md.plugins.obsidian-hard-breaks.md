# Obsidian Hard Breaks Plugin

- GitHub: https://github.com/bkis/obsidian-hard-breaks
- Thoughts:
    - plugin that brings automatic [hard line breaks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.17/#hard-line-breaks) (while writing) and adds an editor command to replace all [soft line breaks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.17/#soft-line-breaks) in a document with hard line breaks
    - This plugin does not work on mobile
