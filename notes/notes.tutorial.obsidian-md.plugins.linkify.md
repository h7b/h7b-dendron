# Linkify

- GitHub: https://github.com/matthewhchan/linkify
- Thoughts:
    - This plugin for Obsidian converts text into links based on regular expressions
    - all text that matches the regular expression will be highlighted as though they were links in Live Preview mode, and clicking on the text will open the link in a browser
    - The underlying text is not modified. This plugin makes no changes to your `.md` files
    - example: `@<name>` will link to `http://twitter.com/<name>`
    - I considered this plugin as a [[text expander|notes.tutorial.text-expander]] dedicated to Obsidian
