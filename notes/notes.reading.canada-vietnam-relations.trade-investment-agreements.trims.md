ref: [Global Affairs Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/invest/trims.aspx?lang=eng), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Trade-Related_Investment_Measures)

The Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) are rules that are applicable to the domestic regulations a country applies to foreign investors

TRIMs are rules that restrict preference of domestic firms and thereby enable international firms to operate more easily within foreign markets. Policies such as local content requirements and trade balancing rules that have traditionally been used to both promote the interests of domestic industries and combat restrictive business practices are now banned.
