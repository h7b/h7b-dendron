# [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)

Puppeteer is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

Puppeteer is a browser automation tool useful for web scraping. Its features are very similar to [[Playwright|notes.tutorial.web-browser-automation.playwright]].

Best choice when we need a full browser rendering the page and [[Playwright|notes.tutorial.web-browser-automation.playwright]] and [[Selenium|notes.tutorial.web-browser-automation.selenium]] can't help. Or we want to control via Javascript instead of Python.
