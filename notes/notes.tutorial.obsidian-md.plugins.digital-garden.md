# Obsidian Digital Garden

- GitHub: https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden
- Thougts:
    - use GitHub repo, deployed via Netlify
    - static site generated by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
    - [demo page](https://notes.ole.dev/set-up-your-digital-garden/), which is also the tutorial from plugin's owner
    - the current easiest free alternative of `Obsidian Publish`, simple, no navigation side bar
    - has a publishing modal called `Publication Center` to make it easier to understand what files were published, which has changed, been deleted and are yet to be published
