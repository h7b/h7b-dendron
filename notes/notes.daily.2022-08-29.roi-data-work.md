# How to think about the ROI of data work

ref: [Mikkel DengsÃ¸e](https://medium.com/data-monzo/how-to-think-about-the-roi-of-data-work-fc9aaac84a3c)

You get asked to estimate the ROI of your work, team or of hiring one more person.

Not all ROI is created equal.

There are five roles in a modern data team. The closer youâ€™re to the left, the closer youâ€™re to systems. The closer to the right, the closer you are to directly impacting a KPI. To keep it simple Iâ€™ll classify these roles into Systems People and KPI People.

The further youâ€™re to the right the more your work should speak for itself through directly impacting a top-line KPI. The further youâ€™re to the left the more the more you have impact by making data consumers downstream more efficient.

Some practical tips to what you can do
- `Systems People`: Focus on maximising the number of consumers of your work (ðŸŽ³) and on the impact your work has on each of them ( ðŸ–‡)
- `KPI People`: Focus on reducing the steps between yourself and the KPI (È ) and work on the highest ROI opportunities (ðŸ’°)

In conclusion, everyone plays a role
- Data Scientists and Data Analysts work faster if they have high quality data and good data models
- Analytics and Data Engineers have multitudes of impact if their data models are used by many.
