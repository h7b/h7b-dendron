### Analyst report

- The Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (Fund) is based on the NASDAQ-100 Index (Index). The Fund will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index. The Index includes securities of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq. The Fund and Index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually
- QQQ was structured as trusts. Trusts, unlike many other equity ETFs,
    - can’t lend out the stocks in their portfolio, and use the revenue to help offset fees
    - They also can’t reinvest dividends, which many buy-and-hold savers prefer
- Big institutional investors and high-speed firms will likely stick with QQQ, at least for now; the larger size makes QQQ cheaper to trade, and the QQQ has a sizable lead when it comes to liquidity.
