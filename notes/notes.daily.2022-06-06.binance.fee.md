# [Fee rates on Binance exchange](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule)

## Purchase Fees

If you choose to buy your cryptocurrencies with a debit or credit card, you can expect to pay up to 4.5% in fees. Because of these fees, you’re better off using other payment methods.

Wire transfers, on the other hand, come with no transaction fee but are not available everywhere. If your location does support wire transfers, you can use them to avoid paying card fees.

## Deposit & Withdrawal Fees

### [When deposit or withdraw Crypto](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee)

There are no fees when depositing crypto assets on Binance. You’ll first need to exchange your fiat for crypto and then make your deposit.

For each withdrawal, a flat fee is paid by users to cover the transaction costs of moving the cryptocurrency out of their Binance account. Withdrawals rates are determined by the blockchain network and can fluctuate without notice due to factors such as network congestion.

## Trading Fees

Binance charges a 0.1% fee for trading on the platform as well as a 0.5% fee for Instant Buy/Sell, so your actual fee amount will depend on the amount of the trade. One way to lower your trading fee is to keep some Binance Coin [[BNB|notes.daily.2022-06-06.binance.bnb]] in your account at all times so your fees can be taken from that. Doing this also fetches you a 25% discount on all trading fees (see [VIP Program](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/vip)).

## What are Market Makers and Takers

When you check Binance fee schedule, you’ll notice that different fees are charged depending on whether you’re a maker or a taker.

According to Binance's [FAQ](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360007720071),
- Taker:
    - When you place an order that trades immediately before going on the order book, you are a **taker**. This is regardless of whether you partially or fully fulfill the order
    - Trades from [market orders](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/12cba755d6334ad98ced0b66ddde66ec) are always takers, as market orders never go on the order book. These trades are "taking" volume off the order book, and therefore are taker trades.
    - Limit immediate or cancel (IOC) and limit fill or kill (FOK) orders (accessible via the API) are also always takers orders.
- Maker:
    - When you place an order that goes on the order book partially or fully, such as a limit order, any subsequent trades coming from that order will be maker trades
    - These orders add volume to the order book, help to make the market, and are therefore termed makers for any subsequent trades
    - If you want to make sure the order goes on the order book before it is filled, please select [Post only](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/5d3fa5e5709f47e0b5f186b350da1655) when placing your order
