# Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-cash-flowratio.asp)

The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a multiple that compares a company's market value to its operating cash flow or its stock price per share to operating cash flow per share.

## Formula

$$Price\ to\ Cash\ Flow = \frac{Share\ Price}{Operating\ Cash\ Flow\ per\ Share}$$

where
- $Share\ Price$ can be the current market price or a 30- or 60-day average price, in order to avoid volatility of random market movements
- $Operating\ Cash\ Flow$ (OCF) is the trailing 12-month (TTM) [[Operating Cash Flow|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.operating-cash-flow]] generated by the firm

## Understanding the P/CF Ratio

A low P/CF multiple may imply that a stock is undervalued in the market.

The P/CF multiple works well for companies that have large non-cash expenses, since the ratio uses [[Operating Cash Flow (OCF)|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.operating-cash-flow]], which adds back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization to Net Income.

P/CF is especially useful for valuing stocks that have positive cash flow but are not profitable because of large non-cash charges.
