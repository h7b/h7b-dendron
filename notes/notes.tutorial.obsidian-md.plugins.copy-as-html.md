# Copy as HTML

- GitHub: https://github.com/mvdkwast/obsidian-copy-as-html
- Thoughts:
    - copy the current document (in Reading view) to the clipboard, so it can be pasted into HTML aware application like gmail
    - Currently working with :
        - images
        - plantuml
        - diagrams
        - obsidian-tasks
        - obsidian-dataview - for large dataview blocks the content may not be complete
        - Excalidraw - rendering as bitmap solves pasting in gmail
