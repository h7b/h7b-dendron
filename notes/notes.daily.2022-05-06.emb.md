### Analyst report

- This ETF offers exposure to debt of emerging markets issuers that is denominated in U.S. dollars, delivering exposure to an asset class that can enhance current returns and deliver geographic diversification without bringing exchange rate fluctuations into the equation
- For investors seeking to diversify exposure to the U.S. dollar, funds like ELD or EMLC might make more sense
- But for those seeking exposure to emerging market debt denominated in the greenback, EMB offers a low cost option that is well diversified and extremely liquid
