[Gates](https://www.gatescarbondrive.com/) Carbon Belt Drive: Everything You Ever Need to Know

The belts themselves are a series of nylon teeth that are reinforced using multiple carbon fibre cords. Belts are then paired with stainless steel cogs and durable alloy chainrings, which results in a super-tough chain alternative that will handle temperatures ranging from -65°F (-53°C) to +185°F (+85°C).

Belt drive is ideal because it’s very low maintenance - often as simple as rinsing the belt/cogs using a water bottle and an old toothbrush - and it offers 3-4X the service life of a chain.

You have to be careful with how you handle belts, as misuse can lead to internal carbon fibre damage
