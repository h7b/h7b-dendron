# Cash Flow Available for Debt Service (CFADS)

Cash flow available for debt service (CFADS) is a ratio that measures the amount of cash a company has on hand relative to its debt service obligations due within one calendar year
- A CFADS ratio under 1 indicates a company can't pay its debts
- ratio at 1 means it just meet its obligations, with no immediate funds on hand
- A ratio above 1 indicates the company can service its debt and have money left over

## Calculation

Two common ways to calculate CFADS:

1. Starting with EBITDA
    - Adjust for changes in net working capital
    - Subtract spending on capital expenditures
    - Adjust for equity and debt funding
    - Subtract taxes

    The following shows an example of how CFADS might be calculated using a cash flow waterfall model starting with Revenue:

2. Starting with Receipts from Customers
    - Subtract payments to suppliers and employees
    - Subtract royalties
    - Subtract spending on capital expenditures
    - Subtract taxes

## Understanding Cash Flow Available for Debt Service (CFADS)

CFADS is often used in project finance, a cost-benefit analysis of the complete life-cycle of a long-term project or investment to determine if it is feasible, and will generate enough cash to cover its costsâ€”to pay for itself.

CFADS is preferred over EBITDA in determining gearing and lending capacity because this measure does not take taxes and timing of cash flows into consideration. EBITDA is a common metric in corporate finance but in project finance the focus is on actual cash flow.

In the next chart, CFADS is plotted against debt service. CFADS is increasing over time while debt service is decreasing over time.
