## Overview

[eToro](https://www.etoro.com/) is a popular trading platform in Europe. eToro started in 2007 in Israel.

It is essential to know that **eToro accounts only hold USD**

## Fees

- 0.50% currency conversion fee when you deposit or withdraw money that is not USD
- 5 USD withdrawal fee
- commission-free investing for stocks and ETFs
- high fees for cryptocurrencies (i.e. 0.75% for Bitcoin and 1.90% on Ethereum)

## Regulations

In Europe, eToro is regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). This entity has an investor protection scheme that could reimburse up to 20,000 EUR in case you would not be able to get back your shares.

### What if eToro bankrupts?

- If you are buying shares without leverage, eToro is buying the underlying assets in your name. They are then put in an omnibus account, which is an account with many people inside. And they are in your name.
    - In theory, if eToro went bust, another financial institution would then give back the shares to the owners. This process could take a long time, but would in the end be completed with everybody back with their shares.
- What is also concerning is that you cannot transfer shares out of eToro. This is a bad sign of what would happen if eToro was to go bankrupt. And you also get no voting rights and cannot register the shares in your name (Direct Registration System)
- In the case of leveraged positions or advanced positions like CFDs, this is much riskier and you are unlikely to get anything back since eToro will not buy the underlying assets.
