# What Is Considered a Healthy EV/EBITDA ?
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp)

> The lower the EV/EBITDA, the cheaper the valuation for a company

- [[enterprise value|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.entreprise-value]] (EV) calculates a company's total value or assessed worth
- the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ([[EBITDA|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.ebitda]]) measures a company's overall financial performance and profitability.

EV/EBITDA ratio is a metric used as a valuation tool to compare the value of a company, debt included, to the companyâ€™s cash earnings less non-cash expenses. It's ideal for analysts and investors looking to compare companies within the same industry.

Typically, when evaluating a company, an EV/EBITDA value below 10 is seen as healthy.
