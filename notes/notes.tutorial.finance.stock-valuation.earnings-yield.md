# Earnings Yield
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsyield.asp)

The earnings yield is the inverse of the [[P/E ratio|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.price-earnings-ratio]])  

Earnings yield is the 12-month earnings divided by the share price.

Earnings yield is one indication of value; a low ratio may indicate an overvalued stock, or a high value may indicate an undervalued stock.

Earnings yield and P/E ratio are the metrics that provide the same information, just in a different way.
