# General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)

ref: [Global Affairs Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/wto-omc/gats-agcs/index.aspx?lang=eng)

The GATS provides a framework of rules governing services trade, establishes a mechanism for countries to make commitments to liberalize trade in services and provides a mechanism for resolving disputes between countries.

Similar in principle to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)|notes.reading.canada-vietnam-relations.trade-investment-agreements.gatt]], which deals with trade in goods, the GATS has two primary objectives: 
- first, to ensure that all signatories are treated equitably when accessing foreign markets; 
- and second, to promote progressive liberalization of trade in services (over time, eliminating trade barriers to enable further participation in one another's markets).
