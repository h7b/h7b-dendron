# Electrical Grid

ref: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid)

An electrical grid is an interconnected network for electricity delivery from producers to consumers. Electrical grids vary in size and can cover whole countries or continents. It consists of:

- power stations: often located near energy and away from heavily populated areas
- electrical substations to step voltage up or down
- electric power transmission to carry power long distances
- electric power distribution to individual customers, where voltage is stepped down again to the required service voltage(s).

The sum of the maximum power outputs (nameplate capacity) of the generators attached to an electrical grid might be considered to be the capacity of the grid
