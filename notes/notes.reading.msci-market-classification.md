### The MSCI market classification framework
The Annual Market Classification Review is based on the [MSCI Market Classification Framework](https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/1330218/MSCI_MARKET_CLASSIFICATION_FRAMEWORK_2021.pdf). The framework consists of the following criteria:
- Economic development: Considers the sustainability of economic development and is only used in determining the classification of developed markets, given the wide range of development levels within emerging and frontier markets
- Size and liquidity requirements: Determines those securities that meet the minimum investability requirements of the MSCI Global Standard Indexes
- Market accessibility criteria: Aims to reflect international institutional investorsâ€™ experiences of investing in a given market and includes five criteria: openness to foreign ownership, ease of capital inflows / outflows, efficiency of operational framework, availability of investment instruments and stability of the institutional framework
