A Statement of Work outlines a project's work requirements. It touches on timelines, project-specific services & activities, deliverables, and budgetary information

A SoW is one of the first documents exchanged between company and client and acts as an informal work contract. 

SoW ensure the transparency between clients and companies
- The SoW ensures that all key parties involved in a project know exactly what's included within the bounds of a project and what isn't
- SoW represents a step ahead of a project proposal
- SoW sets clear expectations for project deliverables, expected outcomes, communications, and timelines on both sides

## Key elements of a Statement of Work

- Basic information about your project
- introduction or project outline
- project background
- scope of work
- A timeline that encompasses key deliverables, milestones, project objectives, due dates, and projected end dates
- A task breakdown, work breakdown or work breakdown structure (WBS)
- Project budget, payment terms, or other financial information. This can also include details about scheduling and resources.
- Any special requirements, resources, or specific terms and conditions.
- General communication criteria and expectations.
- Criteria for modifications of the statement of work
- Project closure protocols that describe the framework of how it will ultimately be concluded, as well as expected outcomes.
- SoW acceptance criteria & authorization documents.
