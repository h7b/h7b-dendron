- One thing that unifies many crypto diehards is the need for institutional investment. Big banks and companies adding crypto to their balance sheet would theoretically increase the demand massively
- Why would a company add crypto in the first place? In the case of Bitcoin, there are a few characteristics that make it valuable; they revolve around Bitcoin as a store of value and an alternative to traditional, centralised banking. Of course, the financial upside is also appealing to many investors as well as the PR such investments generate. Generally, other cryptocurrencies haven’t been adopted by institutions yet
- The biggest institutional holder of Bitcoin is Grayscale. The investment company holds roughly 650,000 Bitcoins on their books, over 3% of the total supply. During their first day of operation in September 2013, Bitcoin was trading at US$125 each
