# Swap

A swap is an **over-the-counter derivative** contract in which two parties agree to exchange a series of cash flows whereby 
- one party pays a variable series that will be determined by an underlying asset or rate 
- and the other party pays either a variable series determined by a different underlying asset or rate or a fixed series.

Swaps go a step further in committing the parties to buy and sell something at a later date: They obligate the parties to a sequence of multiple purchases and sales.

Swaps are relatively young financial instruments, having been created only in the early 1980s. Thus, it may be somewhat surprising to learn that the swap is the most widely used derivative, a likely result of its simplicity and embracement by the corporate world. The most common swap is the **fixed-for-floating interest rate swap** (aka *vanilla swap*).
