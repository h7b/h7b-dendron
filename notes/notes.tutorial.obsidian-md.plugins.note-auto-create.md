# Note Auto Creator for Obsidian

- GitHub: https://github.com/SimonTC/obsidian-note-autocreation
- Thoughts:
    - This plugin automatically create notes whenever a link is created and pointed to these notes
    - After enabling the plugin in the settings menu, you will be able to trigger an alternative link suggestion drop-down
    - The drop-down is triggered by typing the characters configured in the settings menu. By default, the trigger is `@`
    - The suggestion drop-down works as the standard link suggestion activated by typing `[[` with some notable differences
