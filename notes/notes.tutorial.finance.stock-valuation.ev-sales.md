# Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevaluesales.asp)

Enterprise value-to-sales (EV/sales) is a financial valuation measure that compares the [[enterprise value|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.entreprise-value]] (EV) of a company to its annual sales

## Formula

$$EV/Sales=\frac{EV}{Annual Sales}$$

## What Does Enterprise Value-to-Sales Tell You?

Enterprise value-to-sales is an expansion of the [[price-to-sales (P/S)|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.price-sales-ratio]] valuation. 

EV/Sales is perceived to be more accurate than P/S, in part, because the market capitalization alone does not take a company's debt into account when valuing the company, while enterprise value does.

EV-to-sales multiples are usually found to be between 1x and 3x. Generally, a lower EV/sales multiple will indicate that a company may be more attractive or undervalued in the market.
