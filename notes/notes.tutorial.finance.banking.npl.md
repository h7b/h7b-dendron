# Nonperforming Loan (NPL)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonperformingloan.asp)

A nonperforming loan (NPL) is a loan in which the borrower is default and hasn't made any scheduled payments of principal or interest for some time.

In banking, commercial loans are considered nonperforming if the borrower is 90 days past due. However, there is no standard or definition of NPLs.

## Translation to Vietnamese
