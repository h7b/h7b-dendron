# Update Time on Edit

- GitHub: https://github.com/beaussan/update-time-on-edit-obsidian
- Thoughts:
    - This plugins update on save the metadata of the file with the time it was updated, and the time of creation if there is none (useful for new files). The keys can be configured (by default `updated` and `created`)
