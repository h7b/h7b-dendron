# How to rate yourself about your level of expertise in Power BI

ref: [powerbi.tips](https://powerbi.tips/2021/02/power-bi-skills-matrix/)

Based on the skills matrix below, I'm in the range from level 3 to 6. Level 3 if the evaluation test occurs in a confined environment. Level 6 if I have time and leisure to google and prepare report within a timeframe.
