### [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)
- [Pricing plan](https://airtable.com/pricing) starts at USD 12/month
- Limited free tier:
    - unlimited base
    - 1200 records per base
    - 2 GB of attachment storage per base
    - `Share View` feature
- Thoughts: small database use case

### [Rows](https://rows.com/)
- [Pricing plan](https://rows.com/pricing) starts at USD 59/month, with limited free tier  
- Thoughts:
    - similar to [retool](https://retool.com/) which is used to build internal tools
    - read [here](https://blog.rows.com/p/delivering-more-meals-with-rows) to know how a client use `Rows` in their workflow
    - They are really onto something, especially in how to work get structured data out of other systems into a spreadsheet and then work with that kind of data in the "spreadsheet way" that we've all been trained in. This is a pain point of current spreadsheets and one that Rows is addressing in a really nice way (ref: [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29189776))
    - 2022-02-07 evaluation: this app is limited in feature vs google sheets. Rows.com can not customize charts, doesn't have yet function like FILTER. Though it has [workaround](https://forum.rows.com/t/lookup-or-filter-data-using-multiple-criteria/559) with their Range2JSON function. They have some custom function using [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/), as an alternative of [GOOOGLEFINANCE function](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en). After juggling in 2h, I gave up. Switch back to google sheets for publish data on my blog

### [Grid](https://grid.is/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://grid.is/product/pricing) starts at USD 29/month, with good free tier  
- Thoughts:
    - Turn spreadsheets into interactive web documents.

    - GRID does not write back into your original spreadsheet when a GRID document is interacted with or altered
    - Similar to [Causal](https://www.causal.app/)

### [Causal](https://www.causal.app/)

## The 3 types of spreadsheets

ref: [grid.is](https://medium.grid.is/the-3-types-of-spreadsheets-3d021356c002)

spreadsheet in the world is used for one of three things:
- Small databases
- Models
- Business Processes

![grid.is](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*gWLTwAq5U5jVGBTpJPWzgQ.png){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

**Small databases**

Spreadsheet software is the first thing a regular user fires up whenever any data needs to be collected: Contact lists, inventory, logging custom things

These files will usually not have so much as a single formula in them, and the content is often text heavy compared to other spreadsheets. These files ontain 2-dimensional data or more complicated data structures
- multi-dimensional: multiple headers in a table usually add a dimension although obviously still represented in the 2-dimensional grid (a simple intro to multi-dimensional data can be found [here](https://hjalli.medium.com/data-pivots-for-kindergartners-af754db04417))
- hierarchical: some rows in a table are of a lower level and roll up to higher level rows
- relational: data on one sheet refers to details on another

**Models**

These files are usually number-heavy and their defining characteristic is that they have formulas in them. Users are calculating something.

3 sub-categories:
- Projections: Where a lot of data is generated from a relatively small set of input parameters. A common example would be a financial projection based on a set of assumptions (often 1000s of numbers generated from <20 assumptions).
- Analysis: Where a small set of data is calculated from a large set of data, often exported some other system. A typical example would be to calculate average customer spend based on age-group on data exported from a retail system. In this case the spreadsheet is competing directly against purpose-built BI systems, and — in many respects — winning.
- Calculators: This is the most diverse sub-category. Here you’ll find spreadsheets where people are performing some sort of calculations but the balance between the amount of input and output variables is better. An example here might be a mortgage calculator.

**Business Processes**

These are business processes that are run partially or entirely on spreadsheets.

A simple example might be a workplace lunch-order: Fill in the spreadsheet before 11:30 and the order will go out. 

A higher level example might be that every department in the organization has to fill in a spreadsheet template and submit it to HR or Finance before the end of the month. There some poor back-office person aggregates the data into another spreadsheet, enters the results into the payroll system and sends it on to whoever creates the slide-deck for the upcoming board meeting.

And everything between: I’ve seen a spreadsheet that serves as the UI for a large IT company’s billing process. I’ve seen spreadsheets that generate custom portfolio reports for high net-worth individuals in a bank. I’ve seen spreadsheets that are effectively sophisticated CRM-systems.

These spreadsheets are usually accompanied by formalized or not-so-formalized workflows that rely on emailing spreadsheets around, notifying people of changes in a network drive or multiple people working on a spreadsheet stored in the cloud at the same time.

Somewhat tongue-in-cheek, I’ve theorized that every new process within an organization starts out as a spreadsheet before it is (sometimes) formalized in a purpose-built system. That formalization often comes at a great cost, and surprisingly often leads to a solution that is not only much more reliant on IT for operating and maintaining, but also a lot less flexible than the original spreadsheet creation.
