# How Safe Are Nuclear Power Plants

ref: [newyorker](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-safe-are-nuclear-power-plants)

In principle, as mitigating climate change has become a high priority, nuclear energy remains an appealing technology, assuming that the problem of long-term radioactive-waste disposal can be solved.

nuclear power’s potential contribution to clean energy has been compromised by safety shortcuts taken by the industry, and by lax government regulation of day-to-day safety practices at the plants.

Meltdowns—accidents in which the uncontrolled overheating of a reactor’s nuclear fuel creates the potential for the dispersal of radioactive fallout over a large area—were characterized as “incredible events” that, for all policymaking purposes, could be treated as impossible.

A meltdown was supposed to be so unlikely that plant designers were allowed to focus exclusively on preventing lesser mishaps, such as temporary cooling-system malfunctions, and relieved of the responsibility for building safety systems to try to mitigate accidents in which cooling was lost and could not be restored quickly enough.

[Another study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2016.1145910), published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2016, reached the similar conclusion that the “overall probability” of a meltdown in the next decade was almost seventy per cent.
