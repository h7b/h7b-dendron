This is for a US-focused resume.

- One Page Resume
    - keep your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience
    - or at most two pages if you have more than 10 years of experience
- No Objectives
    - an objective will limit you since it'll exclude other positions that might have been interesting to you
- Accomplishment Oriented
    - focus on your accomplishments - that is, the impact you had - rather than your responsibilities. What did you build, create, design, optimize, lead, etc?
- Quantify
    - Whenever possible, you should quantify your accomplishments. If you optimized something, by how much?
