- Percentage: 1.02%
- Current holdings:
    - ![[notes.daily.2022-05-06.vtip#overview,1:#*]]
- Why this asset class and these ETFs?
    - U.S. Inflation-Protected Bonds are issued by the U.S. Treasury with the value of the principal indexed to inflation (but not the interest payments). This set of holdings serves to insulate a part of the portfolio from the depreciating effects of inflation, while also offering historically low correlation with other types of bonds, helping to achieve greater diversification. Additional diversification in a bond portfolio adds a layer of protection during market downturns

- Percentage: 5.82%
- Current holdings:
    - ![[notes.daily.2022-05-06.mub#overview,1:#*]]
    - ![[notes.daily.2022-05-06.tfi#overview,1:#*]]
- Why this asset class and these ETFs?
    - U.S. Municipal Bonds are only included in taxable portfolios, since the interest from them is generally federally tax-exempt. The underlying bonds are issued by state and regional governments to finance capital expenditures, such as infrastructure spending. While municipal bond credit risk is slightly higher than risk-free U.S. Treasuries, it still remains very low, which is attractive for risk-averse investors. This characteristic, coupled with favorable federal tax treatment, makes municipal bonds an excellent addition to taxable portfolios
    - [[MUB|notes.daily.2022-05-06.mub]] is the primary ETF used to gain exposure to U.S. Municipal Bonds, due to its relatively high liquidity
    - The secondary ETF, [[TFI|notes.daily.2022-05-06.tfi]], is similar to MUB but has a slightly higher bid-ask spread.

- Percentage: 1.57%
- Current holdings:
    - ![[notes.daily.2022-05-06.agg#overview,1:#*]]

The underlying bonds in this set of holdings have been rated no lower than BBB- by Standard and Poor's, or Baa3 by Moody's, minimizing credit risk. U.S. High Quality Bonds are still subject to interest rate risk. These bonds are offered by the U.S. government and high-quality u.S. corporations, and also could be comprised of mortgage-backed securities. The average bond maturity of the underlying bonds in this individual asset class is 8 years
    - [[AGG|notes.daily.2022-05-06.agg]] is the primary ETF used to gain exposure to U.S. High Quality Bonds, due to its low bid-ask spread

## International Emerging Market Bonds: 

- Percentage: 2.28%
- Current holdings:
    - ![[notes.daily.2022-05-06.emb#overview,1:#*]]
    - ![[notes.daily.2022-05-06.vwob#overview,1:#*]]
- Why this asset class and these ETFs?
    - International Emerging Market Bonds are dollar-denominated bonds issued by governments with economies that are rapidly growing and industrializing. This component offers higher expected returns than other types of bonds in the portfolio due to higher expected risk. Their unusually low correlation with other bonds results in higher risk-adjusted expected performance for the bond portion of a portfolio.
