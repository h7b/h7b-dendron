# What to look for when buying ETFs
ref: [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-etfs/)

- ETF management fees
- Bid/Ask spreads
    - Low fees are one thing, but are meaningless if the cost of buying and selling an ETF is too high
    - A cost of buying ETFs that is not easily seen by the investor is the bid/ask spread. This is the difference an ETF can be bought or sold for. The ‘spread’ in the middle is essentially the profit margin made by the ‘market maker’, which is the entity who creates the ETF units.
    - Bid/Ask spread is generally driven by a couple of factors
        - The size and liquidity of the ETF. Bigger ETFs generally have a lower bid/ask spread.
        - The size and liquidity of the underlying market. Larger and more liquid markets generally have a lower bid/ask spread.
    - The spreads can be compared by simply checking the market depth on the buy and sell side with the difference being the spread
    - For large, liquid markets, you should try to keep bid/ask spreads under 0.10%. For smaller and less liquid markets, this may be as high as 0.30% (Australian market)
- ETF size
    - ETFs that are larger in size can have lower Bid/Ask spreads than their smaller counterparts
    - advantage that size gets you is reduced risk of an ETF closing
    - We always look for a market capitalisation of at least $50 million before investing in an ETF (Australian market)
- When and how to buy and sell
    - Rule 1: Never buy in the first and last 20 minutes of trading for the day
    - Rule 2: Always use a limit price
        - This is particularly relevant if placing large trades. Unlike normal equities, the market depth that you will see on your broker screen is not the full list of buyers and sellers. A market maker can ‘create’ new ETF units, by buying the underlying assets and turning them into an ETF unit. By using a limit price you’ll give the market maker time to create new units and fulfil your order. A market price on the other hand will fill your order in order of what is shown in the market depth and not give the market maker time to fulfil your order at the better price.
        - Set your limit to the lowest sell price (if buying) or highest buy price (if selling).
- ETF management type
    - Passive ETFs
    - Smart Beta ETFs
        - aka Factor or Strategic Beta ETFs, these track alternative indexes
        - Throwing away the traditional market capitalisation weighted indexes, Smart Beta index look at other factors when developing their index. This may include things like equal weighting, high yield strategies, certain market niches, and ethical investing
    - Active ETFs
