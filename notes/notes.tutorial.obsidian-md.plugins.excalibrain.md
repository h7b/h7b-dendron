# ExcaliBrain

- GitHub: https://github.com/zsviczian/excalibrain
- Thoughts:
    - It is an interactive, structured mind-map of your Obsidian Vault generated based on the folders and files in your Vault by interpreting the links, dataview fields, tags and YAML front matter in your markdown files
    - ExcaliBrain is built on top of [[Dataview|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.dataview]] and [[Excalidraw|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.excalidraw]]. You must have both these plugins installed and enabled for ExcaliBrain to work
