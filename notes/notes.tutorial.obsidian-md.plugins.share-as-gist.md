# "Share as Gist" Obsidian plugin

- GitHub: https://github.com/timrogers/obsidian-share-as-gist
- Thoughts:
    - this plugin allows you to share your notes as [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
    - You can share your notes privately (i.e. only people with the link can see the note) or publicly (i.e. the note is visible on your profile)
    - Once you've created a gist from a note, when you make changes to your note, the published gist can be also updated from Obsidian
