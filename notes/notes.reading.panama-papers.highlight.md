# Notes from reading [[notes.reading.panama-papers]]

## How to structure your own offshore empire?

### Limited Liability Corportation (LLC): legal entities has limited liability. 
- It means that if the company goes bankrupt, the people who have put money into that company cannot lose anymore than the amount they invested.
- Or the investors can comfortably put money towards risky projects without the fear of loosing their life savings if the company itself goes under.

Companies are owned by shareholders.  
3 forms of shareholders:
- natural person (a human person)
- another company (something like warren buffets Berkshire Hathaway which owns hundreds of smaller companies underneath it)
- a trust

### Trust vs Company

Similarities: they 
- are separate legal entities
- can hold assets
- have limited liability

Differences:  
Unlike a company, a trust is much simpler in its operation. A trust is simply an entity that holds onto stuff for the benefit of a pre-determined entity the "beneficiary" and is controlled by another pre-determined entity, the "Trustee"

A simple example is that the beneficiary is some millionaire’s son who receives money from his trust fund that daddy set up for him and the Trustee is the person that has to explain to the pampered 35 year old man-child that he is not letting him withdraw a million dollars from his trust to set up a jet ski jousting league.

### Optimize a company structures

Let’s say you are a very successful businessman. You will have your company here, making profits by providing a marketable good or service.

The most basic way for you to own this company is just to be the direct shareholder of the operation. But if the company is big enough, you really don’t want to do that.
- The reason is that if the company gets sued or goes bankrupt you lose everything. Yes it is a separate legal entity so you won’t personally be liable for any of the companies debts, but you still loose your business and your income stream.

Instead what you do is this  

1. You create a holding company to own all of the shares in that business. And put especially valuable business assets like a warehouse or a shopfront in this holding company.

    Now when your business pays a dividend, it does not go you you directly, it goes to this holding company.
    
    If the operation business back down here gets sued, it doesn’t matter, because it doesn’t own anything that valuable, it can just declare bankruptcy and a new business can be made under the holding company who owns the warehouse and everything else of value.
    
    The holding company is far less likely to be sued than an actual operating business because it basically doesn’t do anything other than own things. It doesn’t enter into contracts, it doesn’t employ people, it doesn’t create products, it doesn’t take on debts, it basically doesn’t do anything that could put it in a position where it could be sued.

2. Next, you want this holding company to in turn be held by a trust. That means that when the holding company passes money up, it doesn’t go directly to you, it goes to this trust, which will then in turn pass money onto you.

3. Now the trust fund needs a trustee, as in the person that decides when and what the trust fund pays to you, the beneficiary. For this you set up yet another company, this company will do nothing apart from decide when money is paid out of the trust fund, it doesn’t even have the authority to decide who it pays it out to, because that is all pre-determined in the rules of the trust itself.

But what does all of this actually do? This makes you financially invincible.

If you actual operating business gets sued and goes bankrupt, oh well, it owns nothing so you can just start another one a week later.

If you get sued and need to declare bankruptcy, that also doesn’t really matter. 

Why?

Well because on paper you don’t own any assets of value.

Sure you keep getting money from the trust fund here, but you can’t own a trust it’s just a pass-through entity.

The only shares that you actually personally own are the ones in the trustee company, but they are worthless, all they do is determine when a trust disbursement is paid, and oh by the way, even if those shares are taken off you, it doesn’t matter anyway because a trust is required by law to payout any cash it has on hand at least once a financial year to stop a situation where a rogue trustee can hold a beneficiaries money hostage.

All of the things of real value are held in this holding company here in the middle of this corporate structure, which means these assets are protected from both sides by what effectively amounts to limited liability corporate meat shields.

It doesn’t matter if anything that has any chance of going bankrupt actually does, because the assets will be safe and sound here in the middle.

There is no need for all of these entities to be registered in the same country. An American business can be owned by a British holding company which feeds money into a trust set up in Singapore which eventually feeds money to a Russian citizen.

Now there is absolutely nothing wrong with this structure, just a bit grey.

It is specifically illegal in most countries to set up corporate structures like this with the sole intention of avoiding taxes.

How a lot of international businesses get around this rule is by saying that there was some other legitimate reason that it needed to be set up amongst so many countries. 

These can include having multiple offices around the world for business functions, owning multiple properties in different countries or even wanting to move money from a country of operation to a country of residence.

If an American investor owned a coal mine in Brazil, there is no problem with them having a Brazilian company owned by an American holding company.

Deciding what international corporate structures are built for legitimate purposes and what structures are built for illegitimate purposes is where it gets difficult.

Some jurisdictions have more registered corporations than citizens so auditing every single last one of them is just not feasible. 

Even if it was, the guilty parties could very easily get around this issue by having a string of multiple holding companies which are each in a country with strong corporate privacy laws.
- Take example: If the Singaporean authorities get suspicious about a domestic holding company which is in turn held by another foreign holding company they would need to ring up the business regulator from the country where that other holding company is domiciled and ask them for details on that companies ownership structure.
- If that company is set up in a place like Montenegro, then the Singaporean financial authorities are likely to just get told to go duck themselves because local laws mean that kind of information is kept secret.

## Why these Panama Papers data leaks were such a big deal

For the first time financial authorities and regular citizens alike had complete transparency of the structures that had been set up by some of the wealthiest people in the world.

Again while none of this was illegal by itself, it’s pretty clear that someone putting this much time, effort and money into making such a complex and opaque international business structure is not doing it just for asset protection or business operations.

There is a common trend that was found amongst most of the more questionable leaked files. The operating businesses were usually based in countries with less than stellar records with corruption, the money from them would then be transferred to holding companies that
operated in much more politically stable jurisdictions.

It’s not worth going to all of this effort to hide and secure your assets if they just get seized in some political revolution or economic meltdown. These holding companies in these stable countries would then be owned by a string of trusts and companies before ultimately been fed back to their owner in whatever country they lived in.

## So has anything actually been done about this?

The information revealed in the Panama Papers and other subsequent leaks has led to the arrest of dozens of high profile officials, the resignation of a prime minister and the return of hundreds of billions of dollars to tax agencies all over the world.

The second thing it did was introduce widely recognized standards for registered companies to list beneficial owners.
- If you try to set up a new business today in most countries around the world a major question you will get asked is who are the beneficial owners.
- A beneficial owner is the natural person that receives the profits from the business at the end of everything.
- The need for it to be a natural person means that the endless cobweb of shell companies does nothing because you still need to list an actual person at the end of it all.

The third thing it did was heightened the scrutiny placed on certain individuals known in the industry as PEP’s or Politically Exposed Persons.
- If the beneficial owner of a company is someone who holds public office or a senior position in a large company they are liable to be involved in corruption.
- It’s because of this that new international banking laws require that these individuals declare themselves when doing so much as opening a bank account.
- This means that countries know where to start when auditing new companies, minimizing the chances that these individuals can hide their ill-gotten gains.

The final major thing is the push for a global minimum tax.
- Ireland, a famous destination international corporate structures agreed to implement a 15% corporate tax rate as part of the global minimum tax rate proposal.
- This scheme would likely not have nearly the momentum it has today if it weren’t for these leaks exposing just how big this issue was.
