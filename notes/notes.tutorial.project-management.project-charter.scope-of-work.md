A Scope of Work is a section within a Statement of Work.

It defines what work is included within the scope of your project and what isn't. This is key for both the company and the client as it defines exactly what should be expected by both parties within the framework of your project.

- Having a written record of important information
- Keeping project team members on track
- Scope creep avoidance
- Increased communication
- Staying within your budget

- Key project information 
- Project overview

- An out-of-scope list: If there's anything you want to make absolutely clear is not accounted for within the bounds of your project, it's a great idea to list it here

## Difference between a Scope of Work and a Statement of Work
Statements of work and scopes of work are very closely related documents, so they're often confused.
- A Scope of Work document is usually a section or a page within a Statement of Work. 
    - A statement of work is a much longer and more detailed project management document that outlines all the most important elements of a project.
    - A statement of work is a formal document that's essential to the project planning process and sometimes even acts as a work agreement or initial contract between service provider and client
- A scope of work is a shorter, more concise document that focuses on exactly what elements make up a given project
