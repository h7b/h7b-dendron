# Possible to have different theme/font settings for Windows and iOS?

Ref: read more at [link](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/possible-to-have-different-theme-font-settings-for-macos-and-ios/21468)

You can use different configuration folders for mobile and desktop (Settings > About > Override config folder). You will have to choose a name for the folder. .obsidian.mobile is an example. Your settings will not sync between devices, but you will be able to choose a different theme or font for each device.
