# Tether Fees

ref: [tether.to](https://tether.to/en/fees/)

Verified users can redeem USDT for USD 1:1 but
- Tether reserves the right to delay the redemption or withdrawal of Tether Tokens if such delay is necessitated by the illiquidity or unavailability or loss of any Reserves held by Tether to back the Tether Tokens, and Tether reserves the right to redeem Tether Tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities and other assets held in the Reserves. Tether makes no representations or warranties about whether Tether Tokens that may be traded on the Site may be traded on the Site at any point in the future, if at all
- Fee per fiat withdrawal: The greater of $1,000 or 0.1%
- Tether does offer redemption, but the minimum amount you can redeem is 100,000 USDT, and there is a fee that ranges from 0.1% to 1% depending on the size of the redemption. [^1]

So if a well-capitalized arbitrageur can buy a million USDT at a price less than 0.999, they can redeem them for a profit, as long as Tether keeps honoring redemptions. [^2]
