# Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp)

Companies use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value.

## Formula

$$P/B=\frac{Market\ Price\ per\ Share}{Book\ Value\ per\ Share}$$

where
- $Market\ Price\ per\ Share$ = the share price quote in the market
- $Book\ Value\ per\ Share=\frac{Total\ Assets-Total\ Liabilities}{number\ of\ shares\ outstanding}$

## Understanding the P/B Ratio

The P/B ratio reflects the value that market participants attach to a company's equity relative to the book value of its equity.
- A stock's market value is a forward-looking metric that reflects a company's future cash flows
- The book value is the net assets of a company. In other words, if a company liquidated all of its assets and paid off all its debt, the value remaining would be the company's book value

The P/B ratio provides a valuable reality check for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price and is often looked at in conjunction with [[return on equity (ROE)|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.return-on-equity]], a reliable growth indicator. 
- Large discrepancies between the P/B ratio and ROE often send up a red flag on companies. Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and high P/B ratios
- If a company's ROE is growing, its P/B ratio should also be growing

The P/B ratio has been favored by value investors for decades and is widely used by market analysts. Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B for value investors, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors may often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0 as their benchmark.
