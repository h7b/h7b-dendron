# Loan Life Coverage Ratio (LLCR)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llcr.asp)

The loan life coverage ratio (LLCR) is a financial ratio used to estimate the solvency of a firm, or the ability of a borrowing company to repay an outstanding loan.

LLCR is a ratio commonly used in project finance.

LLCR measures how many times the discounted [[Cash Flow Available for Debt Service (CFADS)|notes.tutorial.finance.banking.cfads]] over the scheduled life of the loan can repay the outstanding debt balance over the life of a loan.
- A ratio of 1.0x means that LLCR is at a break-even level 
- The higher the ratio, the less potential risk there is for the lender

## Calculation

$$LLCR = \frac{Net\ Present\ Value\ (CFADS\ over\ loan\ life)}{Outstanding\ Debt\ in\ the\ period}$$

where
- $CFADS=$ [[Cash Flow Available for Debt Service|notes.tutorial.finance.banking.cfads]]
