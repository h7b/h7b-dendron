# Private and shared vaults

ref: [Dendron wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6DZiBObwhZNYRjnokQ422/)

You want to use Dendron for personal and professional use, keeping some notes private, while sharing others with other team members (or yourself on different machines). Some of these notes, in turn, may be published, whereas others, not.

This [workflow tutorial]((https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6DZiBObwhZNYRjnokQ422/)) will walk you through the process.
