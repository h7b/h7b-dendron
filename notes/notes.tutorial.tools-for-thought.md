# Tools for writing notes, PKM, team knowledge base, technical documents then publish online

PKM: Personal Knowledge Management

## Things I use

### [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)

- Publishing:
  - [[Self-hosted|notes.tutorial.dendron]]
      - Pricing: free
  - Managed Publishing
      - Official website: [Dendron wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a6b9c043-7713-48ea-b826-50d003e3e21f/)
      - This feature is enabled by making a [financial contribution](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/abda4d2a-d8a2-4dd6-8ea0-4a5661fa13c1/) to Dendron. 
      - Their [pricing](https://accounts.dendron.so/account/subscribe) starts at USD 5/month. Another [pricing page](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/abda4d2a-d8a2-4dd6-8ea0-4a5661fa13c1/). Imho, Dendron needs to consolidate their pricing plans.
- Thoughts: can [refactor notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/srajljj10V2dl19nCSFiC/) with their hierarchy and reference links

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)  
- Difficulty to setup: 1/5  
- Publishing:
  - Obsidian Publish plugin
      - Official website: https://obsidian.md/publish
      - Pricing: start at USD 20/month per site
      - easiest way to publish notes with Obsidian
  - [[3rd-party solution|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.tips-obs.publish-alternatives]]  
      - Pricing: free
      - have to read tutorial to setup. Not easy for non-techie

### [Fibery](https://fibery.io/)
- Difficulty to use: 2/5  
- [Pricing plan](https://fibery.io/pricing) starts at USD 10/month/user, with a generously unlimited free tier for individual use.  
- Publishing: share article only  
- Thoughts: I currently use as a database, great gratis alternative of [Airtable](https://wwww.airtable.com/)

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)  
- Difficulty to use: 1/5  
- [Pricing plan](https://www.notion.so/pricing), starting at USD 10/month per user. It has an unlimited free tier for individual use.

## Things I played with

### [[Logseq|notes.tutorial.logseq]]
![[notes.tutorial.logseq#overview,1:#*]]

### [Coda](https://coda.io/)
- Difficulty to use: 1/5  
- Pricing: limited free tier. Their [pricing](https://coda.io/pricing) starts at USD 12/month per Doc Maker (have the ability to create new docs)  
Thoughts: it has an advantage with the embedded [[inline formula in Coda|notes.tutorial.calculation-in-txt-editor#coda]]

### [Affine](https://affine.pro/)
- an open source alternative of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- They aim to replace Notion, [Miro](https://miro.com/), [Monday](https://www.monday.com/)

### [Remnote](https://www.remnote.com/)
- Difficulty to use: 2/5  
- [Pricing plan](https://www.remnote.com/pricing) starts at USD 6/month, with a free tier for individual use.  
Thoughts: some frequently used feature (eg. aliases, graph view, templates) are moved to paid tier. The unique selling point of this product is its spaced repetition flashcards and unlimited notes in free tier.

### [Anytype](https://anytype.io/en)
- Difficulty to use: 2/5  
- Thoughts: I can't understand their logic with relation and objects. Need more time to play and learn its features.

### [Innos Note](https://innos.io/)
- Difficulty to setup: 1/5  
- Thoughts: currently provide only `Sign in with Google` (2021-11-01), so I hesitate to test. But their demo public note [Book Recommendation](https://innos.io/space/7ecfa27d-bda6-c188-4418-f4189244b425?p=7ecfa27d-bda6-c188-4418-f4189244b425) looks great. However, its owner, [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), is a subsidiary of [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/). Although [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/) is based in Singapore, ByteDanceâ€™s ownership might be problematic.

### [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/)
- [Pricing plan](https://www.larksuite.com/pricing) is currently set to free.
- Thoughts:
  - alternative of Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 and Notion
  - [Bitable](https://www.larksuite.com/hc/en-US/articles/360048488253) is its approach to database inside a document, with [two-way links](https://www.larksuite.com/hc/en-US/articles/360048488383) support, similar to Notion or Airtable
  - [Wiki](https://www.larksuite.com/hc/en-US/articles/360048488372) is their feature for team knowledge base, as the current offer of Notion and others
  - [Lark Flow](https://www.larksuite.com/hc/en-US/articles/360048487755-Workplace-How-to-use-Lark-Flow) is the automation tool similar to [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Microsoft Power Automate](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/)

### [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
- Difficulty to setup: 3/5  
- [Pricing plan](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) starts at USD 8/month. Free for individual use, with 10 public and private spaces, custom domains included.  
Thoughts: This is a solution for technical project documentation, rather a pkm like Dendron or Obsidian.

### [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)  
- Pricing: `Community version` is free  
![[notes.tutorial.mkdocs-publish-obsidian#overview,1:#*]]

### [[Docusaurus|notes.tutorial.docusaurus]]  
- Difficulty to setup: 4/5  
- Pricing: free  
![[notes.tutorial.docusaurus#thoughts,1:#*]]

### [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/)  
- Difficulty to setup: 4/5  
- Pricing: free  
- Thoughts: not easy to setup and maintain

### [Retype](https://retype.com/)  
- Difficulty to setup: 4/5  
- Pricing: free. Developers are discussing a [pricing plan](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/discussions/224), which limits the max pages per project in free tier to 100.  
- Thoughts: alternative of [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

### [Almanac](https://almanac.io/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://almanac.io/pricing) starts at USD 12/month. Free for personal use  
- Pros: Organize doc versions using Git-like version control

### [Slite](https://slite.com/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://slite.com/pricing) starts at USD 8/month with limited free tier   
- Thoughts: Equivalent offer to Notion, don't have database yet (as on 2011-11-12)

### [Bit.ai](https://bit.ai/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://bit.ai/pricing) starts at USD 8/month with limited free tier  
- Thoughts: alternative of Notion and Coda

### [Document360](https://document360.com/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://document360.com/pricing/) starts at USD 99/month/project with 14-day free trial only  
- Thoughts: Can customize your own branding, navigations & menu, custom domain

### [appflowy](https://www.appflowy.io/)  
- Thoughts: new open source Notion alternative, founded in 2021-11. Promising but currently not available

### [Unigraph](https://unigraph.dev/)  
- Thoughts: combination of outliner type (eg. [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)) and many other features (rss reader, email, feeds and inbox). Promising but currently not available.

### [Heptabase](https://heptabase.com/)  
- Thoughts: combination of whiteboard and note taking. Promising but currently not available for public. 
- 2022-01, they have private beta for paid subscribers in their discord server 

### [Siyuan](https://b3log.org/siyuan/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://b3log.org/siyuan/pricing.html) starts at RMB 96/year for cloud service features like data synchronization, backups. The product is completely free for individual use.  
- Thoughts: initially developped as a copycat of Notion and Obsidian for Chinese market. But their UI looks great now. They have a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan) for international community. The notes are stored in a database instead of plaintext markdown files like Obsidian or Dendron. Since this is designed for Mainland China market, I hesitated to experiment.

### [Notabase](https://notabase.io/)  
- Pricing plan starts at USD 7/month. Limited free tier with 100 notes only.  
- Thoughts: I can't find a reason to try this one, since there are many better free alternatives like Obsidan and Dendron. Notabase has open source version for self-host. There's also a recently released fork called [mdSilo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29969757).

### [Tettra](https://tettra.com/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://tettra.com/pricing/) starts at USD 10/month. Generous free [Starting plan](https://support.tettra.co/en/articles/4394100-starting-plan-user-limit) for small teams, up to 10 users  
- Thoughts: designed for teams not individual, good [search experience](https://support.tettra.co/en/articles/2548482-searching-in-tettra), has [version history](https://support.tettra.co/en/articles/365164-version-history-page-revisions) for documents, has an [internal question & answer](https://support.tettra.co/en/articles/5191953-questions-answers-overview) that let team members request answers from the subject-matter internal experts, can create [link between documents](https://support.tettra.co/en/articles/615205-internal-page-linking), has a [verification system](https://support.tettra.co/en/articles/4632643-verification) to verify documents

### [Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/)  
- [Pricing plan](https://www.nuclino.com/pricing) starts at EUR 6/month, with 14-day trial. Really limited free tier  
- Thoughts: similar to Notion, with less object types, has real time editing view for teams and a wiki concept, better for team than individual use.

### [Saga](https://saga.so/)  
- Thoughts: currently in beta. At first glance, it seems to be another clone of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

### [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)  
- [Pricing](https://hackmd.io/pricing) starts at USD 5/month. Free tier is offered for team less than 3.    
- Thoughts: 
    - real-time collaborative edit in markdown for team. With the limit of 20 push to Git repo per month, their free tier is not attractive enough to experiment, compared to Notion. 
    - [CodiMD](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd) is their self-hosted version. Another forked version, maintained by community is [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/)

### [Athens](https://www.athensresearch.org/)  
- Thoughts: open source, alternative of Roam, Logseq. User base is significant less than Logseq

### [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)  
- [Pricing](https://www.inkdrop.app/pricing) starts at USD 5/month. Free trial only  
- Thoughts: cross platform markdown note app. Alternative of Obsidian. I can't find enough interest to experiment a note-taking app with a monthly subscription. 

### [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.com/)
- [Pricing](https://readthedocs.com/pricing/) starts at USD 50/month. Free [community version](https://readthedocs.org/) for open source projects. Not free for individual use
- Thoughts: 
  - alternative of [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
  - can [export to other formats](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/downloadable-documentation.html) like pdf or epub

### [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)

  - support Markdown or [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html) to write [narrative content](https://jupyterbook.org/content/index.html)
  - [executable content](https://jupyterbook.org/content/executable/index.html) like code outputs and interactive data visualization is also integrated

### [Readme](https://readme.com/)

  - only web version, not yet mobile or desktop apps

### [Scrintal](https://www.scrintal.com/)
- 2022-03-15, currently available only to private waitlist
- the product self claim as a sweet blend of [Miro](https://miro.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- I considered this as an alternative of [Heptabase](https://heptabase.com/)

### [Stacks](https://stacks.rocks/)
- [Pricing](https://stacks.rocks/pricing/) is one-time payment of USD 49
- Thoughts:
  - This is inclined to an offline project management apps, similar to [Trello](https://trello.com/en)
  - Documents are stored in editable text based JSON files
  - Sync your workspace through iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive or any service of your choice

### [acreom](https://acreom.com/)

- publish for free on [TiddlyHost](https://tiddlyhost.com/)
- review
    - [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial)
- thoughts:
    - notes are stored as `.tiddler` files. Obsidian community tried to [export tiddler to Obsidian](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/import-from-tiddlywiki-5-to-obsidian/731/2)
    - I can't find specific reason to experiment this. Obsidian or Dendron are much simpler and better
