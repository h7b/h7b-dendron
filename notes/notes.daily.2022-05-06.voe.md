### Analyst report

- Be noted that [[IWS|notes.daily.2022-05-06.iws]] and JKI seek to replicate similar indexes at comparable expense ratios
- Investors constructing a long-term portfolio would be better off with a fund such as MDY or IJH that includes greater depth of holdings and a mix of various styles
- Rydex offers a pure style alternative, RFV, that is slightly more expensive but will offer a considerably more targeted focus on value equities
