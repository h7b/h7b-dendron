# DCF model for Firm with stable growth

aka Gordon growth model or constant growth forever

$$V_0=\frac{CF_1}{r-g}$$

where:
- $V_0=$ Value of Equity (if cash flows to equity are discounted) or Firm (if cash flows to firm are discounted)
- $CF_1=$ Cash Flow in period after the most recent $CF_0$; Dividends or FCFE if valuing equity; FCFF if valuing firm
- $r=$ Cost of Equity (if discounting Dividends or FCFE) or Cost of Capital (if discounting FCFF)
- $g=$ Expected growth in Cash Flow being discounted in stable period

Use the stable growth model, if the firm is growing at a rate which is below or close (within 1-2%) to the growth rate of the economy
