# Better File Link

- GitHub: https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/obsidian-file-link
- Thoughts:
    - Enhance the UX of selecting files and creating link to local files, right from within Obsidian
    - Don't need to open a new Finder/File Explorer window, then manually drag and drop files into your note
