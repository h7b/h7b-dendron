Current assets represent all the assets of a company that are expected to be conveniently sold, consumed, used, or exhausted through standard business operations with one year.

Key Components of Current Assets
- Cash and cash equivalents
- short-term or liquid investments in marketable securities, such as interest-bearing short-term Treasury bills or bonds
- Accounts Receivable
- Inventory
- Prepaid Expenses
  - which represent advance payments made by a company for goods and services to be received in the future
  - Prepaid expenses could include payments to insurance companies or contractors
  - Although Prepaid expenses cannot be converted into cash, they are the payments already made. Such components free up the capital for other uses
