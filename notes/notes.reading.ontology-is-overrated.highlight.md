# Notes from reading [[notes.reading.ontology-is-overrated]]

Ontology, in the philosophical sense, is the study of entities and their relations.  
In a particular domain, what kinds of things can we say exist in that domain, and how can we say those things relate to each other?

categorization and classification are the act of organizing a collection of entities, whether things or concepts, into related groups

ontological classification or categorization is organizing a set of entities into groups, based on their essences and possible relations.  
A library catalog, for example, assumes that for any new book, its logical place already exists within the system, even before the book was published

versus Google's link only approach. One reason Google was adopted so quickly when it came along is that Google understood there is no shelf, and that there is no file system. Google can decide what goes with what after hearing from the user, rather than trying to predict in advance what it is you need to know.

When Does Ontological Classification Work Well?  
- When the Domain to be Organized has these characteristics 
    - Small corpus
    - Formal categories
    - Stable entities
    - Restricted entities
    - Clear edges
- When the Participants of this Domain are
    - Expert catalogers
    - Authoritative source of judgment
    - Coordinated users
    - Expert users

Inversely, where ontological classification doesn't work well?
- Domain
    - Large corpus
    - No formal categories
    - Unstable entities
    - Unrestricted entities
    - No clear edges
- Participants
    - Uncoordinated users
    - Amateur users
    - Naive catalogers
    - No Authority

The list of factors making ontology a bad fit is, also, an almost perfect description of the Web -- largest corpus, most naive users, no global authority, and so on. The more you push in the direction of scale, spread, fluidity, flexibility, the harder it becomes to handle the expense of starting a cataloguing system and the hassle of maintaining it, to say nothing of the amount of force you have to get to exert over users to get them to drop their own world view in favor of yours.

One of the biggest problems with categorizing things in advance is that it forces the categorizers to take on two jobs that have historically been quite hard: mind reading, and fortune telling. It forces categorizers to guess what their users are thinking, and to make predictions about the future.
- Mind Reading
    - Apple/Mac/OSX example, all should be a same category or not?
- Fortune Telling
    - for example `East Germany`, `Soviet Union` are not stable category, since countries are social fictions.
