# Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR)

The loan-to-deposit ratio is used to assess a bank's liquidity by comparing a bank's total loans to its total deposits for the same period.

Typically, the ideal loan-to-deposit ratio is 80% to 90%. A loan-to-deposit ratio of 100 percent means a bank loaned one dollar to customers for every dollar received in deposits it received.

## Calculation

$$LDR = \frac {Total\ Loans}{Total\ Deposits}$$

## What Does LDR Tell You?

A loan-to-deposit ratio shows a bank's ability to cover loan losses and withdrawals by its customers. Investors monitor the LDR of banks to make sure there's adequate liquidity to cover loans in the event of an economic downturn resulting in loan defaults.

Also, the LDR helps to show how well a bank is attracting and retaining customers. If a bank's deposits are increasing, new money and new clients are being on-boarded. As a result, the bank will likely have more money to lend, which should increase earnings.
