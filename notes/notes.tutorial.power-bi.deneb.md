This is similar to the approaches used for creating R and Python visuals in Power BI, with the following additional benefits:
- Libraries are packaged with the visual, so no additional dependencies on local libraries or gateways for your end-users when publishing reports
- Specifications are rendered inside the Power BI client, rather than being delegated to another location, typically resulting in faster render times for end-users
- Built for the web, meaning that it's possible to integrate with Power BI's interactivity features, with some additional setup
