# CSV Table in Obsidian

- GitHub: https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-csv-table
- Thoughts:
    - render a csv file as a table in Obsidian's reading mode
    - You can use the `columns` field to control which columns of your CSV file to be displayed
    - You can use a `filter` expression to display only a subset of data from your csv file
