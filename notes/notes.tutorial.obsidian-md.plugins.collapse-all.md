# Collapse All (Obsidian Plugin)

- GitHub: https://github.com/OfficerHalf/obsidian-collapse-all
- Thoughts:
    - When your Obsidian file explorer is overloaded with open folders, collapse them all with a single click / command. Inversely, if you want to explore your folder tree, expand all folders
