## Part 1

*Hi, Vivek here. Hope you are staying indoors. Covid is not over yet.*

*Few points before we jump into the piece.*

1.  *This is a beginner's guide to IPOs. Like really basic. So feel free to jump out if you are a finance star.*
    
2.  *I worked on 2 IPOs and a re-IPO (yes, this happens) during my time at Goldman Sachs which helped me add a bit more detail to this piece.*
    
3.  *The IPO process is largely similar across countries. There are differences of course but only when you get into the finer details like registration forms, eligibility criteria, etc. I have kept the piece US and India centric but it applies to other regions as well.*

Describing the IPO process normally can get really boring. So I decided to tell it through the lens of a fictional story. Here we go.

## Step 1: Path to Profitability

**Investor Raj** walked to the elevator nervously excited. Today was going to kickstart the culmination of years of hard work and patience on one of his investments - TinyPanda.

Incorporated by **Founder Lata** after she created an exceedingly good file compression algorithm, TinyPanda built a compressor app to be sold to consumers. Lata spent all her savings and hired 2 developers to help her build the first version of the app. As the number of app users grew to 1000+, Lata had to hire a few more people - customer support staff, marketers, etc. She needed more money to hire these folks and turned to friends and family for help. When the app crossed 10,000 users, even money from friends wasn't enough. She needed a larger sum. It was time to raise money from an institutional investor (in this case, a [venture capitalist](https://www.simplanations.in/p/2-how-vc-works-a-beginners-guide)).

It was around this time that Raj and his team first met with Lata. Impressed by the performance of the product and aware of the growing data storage needs for even a layperson, Raj decided to write a cheque.

The consumer app, however, plateaued in growth after 20,000 users. Raj realized that while Lata had a quality product in hand, she was selling it to the wrong set of people. Raj and Lata worked hard to pivot TinyPanda to a file storage software product (built on top of the compression algorithm) that could be sold to corporates. The revenue needle did move up a bit but they soon realized they were in a heavily competitive space which included giants like Google and Dropbox.

Back to the drawing board again, they pulled back the file storage product and decided to sell only the compression algorithm as a subscription service - a compression layer between the place where information is generated and where information is stored. The sell was simple - pay a monthly amount based on the amount of data compressed and save loads on data storage costs. It was a masterstroke. TinyPanda didn't need to compete with file storage companies anymore; it could be used along with them. And the more data corporates stored (which was bound to grow), the more TinyPanda earned. Growth exploded with the new model and TinyPanda was set on a clear path to profitability.

It was now time for Raj and all the other investors who had backed Lata during the tumultuous journey of all the pivots to begin thinking of their 'exit' - so they could en-cash their shares and make a good return for all the risk they took. With the kind of money TinyPanda was raking in, all the investors agreed that taking the company public was the best exit scenario compared to selling TinyPanda to another company.

It was for this reason that Raj found himself on this elevator heading up to the conference room on the 7th floor. The board of directors of TinyPanda were meeting to discuss when and how to take the company public.

> *Theory time!  
> Hello, this is Bala. You haven't met me yet but I am a character who appears later in the story. I will be jumping out of the story to explain certain concepts to you from time to time. Let's begin.*
> 
> ***What does going 'public' mean?**  
> It's when a company decides to offer its shares to a larger group of people - individuals like you and me (called "retail investors") and institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, etc (called "institutional investors") which are mandated to invest their money only in trustworthy public companies. Since it's the first time the company is doing such a thing, it's called "Initial Public Offering (IPO)". Before going public, the company's shares are largely held by the founders & their family and/or by venture capitalists and private equity firms. Going public is also called '**listing**' since the share is listed on a stock exchange like the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the IPO. Once listed, anyone can start buying or selling shares of that company via the stock exchange which wasn't possible when the company was private.*
> 
> ***Are all the shares issued new?**  
> There are two kinds of shares being offered in an IPO.*
> 
> 1.  *Existing shares held by current investors. These shares (called "secondary offering") just exchange hands during the IPO from current investors (who are "exiting" the investment) to new investors. The money raised from these shares goes to the investors' pockets and not the company's coffers.*
>     
> 2.  *New shares. These shares (called "primary offering") are created during the IPO process. The money from these shares goes to the company's coffers. If you are investing in the IPO, it wouldn't matter to you which share you are buying since they are all priced the same. Most IPOs have both kinds of shares on offer and secondary shares, typically, are the larger component. This makes IPO more of an "exit event for current investors" than a "fundraising round for the company". This is a very important distinction to keep in mind and look out for while evaluating IPOs. In TinyPanda's case, it's primarily going to be an exit event.*

## Step 2: Board Resolution

Seated alone in the conference room, Founder Lata had mixed feelings. The board members, in this very room a few minutes ago, had voted to kickstart the IPO process for TinyPanda - the company she founded 6 years ago. Lata was both anxious and happy about the impending change TinyPanda was about to go through.

Anxious because the IPO process involved intense scrutiny of the company's business plan and financials. It would be the first time TinyPanda's value would be determined, not just by a handful of people like in previous fundraising rounds, but by a larger group of public market investors - a real test of the company's worth. This process was also going to be mentally and financially taxing coupled with the risk of falling through (like WeWork's IPO did) - a public relations disaster.

At the same time, Lata was also happy because going public did have its benefits. The intense scrutiny, while a source of anxiety initially, would also pave way for trust and transparency - foundations on which a long-lasting company is built. This trust would also ease their efforts to raise funds from banks (in the form of loans) instead of selling part of ownership (equity). The ensuing media coverage would strengthen the brand easing hiring and possibly attract new customers as well. And most importantly to her, it was an opportunity for all the employees of TinyPanda to get rewarded for all their hard work by exercising their stock options during the IPO.

This decision to take TinyPanda public wasn't a sudden move. Things like this don't happen on a whim. The vision of TinyPanda as a public company was set more than 18 months ago after the company cracked the right model of selling its product and profitability became a reality. Over the next few months, Lata spent time readying the company in anticipation of a potential IPO. This meant figuring out the right organization hierarchy and structure, hiring key management personnel (hiring a stellar person to head sales, a chief financial officer with a solid track record that future public investors could trust, etc), putting legally required checks in place (called "corporate governance"), rechecking if all the legal registrations are in place, and creating a solid growth plan for the future.

With the board now having given a green light to start the IPO proceedings, it was time to choose an investment bank that would advise and lead the process.

## Step 3: Choosing the Investment Banker

**Banker Bala** smiled, clearly pleased with himself (yes, it's me, the same Bala you met earlier). He was sitting in the corner office on the 18th floor of JP Murugan, a large investment bank. A decade spent here and he was now the managing director of the equity capital markets division. And he smiled the same smile every time his plan worked to perfection. He had just gotten news that TinyPanda had chosen JP Murugan to advise on their IPO.

**Analyst Anil** was sitting at his desk observing Bala's office through the corner of his eye. Boss seemed to be in a good mood. Great! Good time to have a chat with the boss. Anil’s summer internship was coming to an end soon and he wanted to maximise his face-time with the boss. Apparently, that would help him score brownie points and hopefully convert this internship to a full-time job offer. Anil walked over to Bala's office and peeked in.

“Hey Bala, good time to chat? Thought I will catch up and check how my internship is going.”

“Hey Anil, come in. Great timing actually. You remember the TinyPanda RFP that you worked on for the last 3 weeks? We just got the mandate.”

“Oh that’s great to hear. Seems like our RFP pitch did the trick".

Anil remembered that the RFP or “Request for Proposal” that Bala was referring to was an invitation TinyPanda sent to investment banks. The banks got 3 weeks to prepare & submit a pitch to TinyPanda about why they should be chosen to advise on the IPO. Around a dozen banks had gotten the RFP. And 6 were shortlisted to present in person at TinyPanda's office based on which the final advisors were chosen.

Bala laughed loudly at Anil's innocent statement.

"Anil, tell me what did we include in the pitch deck we sent them?"

Anil excitedly started listing down what had gone into the RFP (brownie points, remember?)

"Well, we included our understanding of the data compression market and how TinyPanda's product fit into the market. And why we thought it is such a great business. We also included what we thought TinyPanda's valuation should be. Post that, it was mostly about us - our past experience of advising on other software IPOs and how we are global leader in IPO advisory, the details of the team who would we involved in TinyPanda's IPO, and lastly, our strategy on marketing TinyPanda's IPO and the support we will extend them even after the IPO."

Bala listened patiently, nodding his head at every point.

"Ok Anil, what do you think the other banks would have pitched?"

"Umm, I guess the same things??"

"Exactly! The services offered by investment are what we call 'commoditized'. There's hardly any difference between what each bank offers. It's not like our advice is better than Citibank's. Most of the big banks have been around so long that most of this process is figured out and set as a template. So the RFP pitch, while necessary, doesn't actually influence the end result much. It is just a task on the checklist that we have to tick."

More than surprised at what Bala had just said, Anil was thinking about the long nights he had spent on the RFP pitch and cursing himself for wasting his time. He quickly pulled himself together and asked

"So what actually helped us get the mandate?"

Anil noticed the same smile spread across Bala's face that he had seen before entering the office.

"Investor Raj and I were in the same MBA class years ago. I had been building a relationship with Raj for a while now so I have first preference on all his investments that would go public. For clients like Raj, knowing that a familiar face is advising on the IPO helps a lot. Remember, in investment banking, the hands you shake are more important than the things you make. This is the reason why we hire from elite universities. As you and your peers climb up the ladder, you have access to an invaluable network."

Anil was surprised. Bala must be in a really good mood to be spilling out trade secrets like this. But he was glad this was happening. His plan to get face-time with his boss and build a relationship with him did seem to be on the right track. Anil prodded further

"I see. So because of this relationship, JP Murugan is the only one that got the mandate"

"No no no. We are not the only ones. Those pesky idiots at Silverman & Silverman (S&S) and Bakarwaleys also sneaked into the deal."

"Wait, so how does that work? Won't there be clashes if multiple people are advising?"

"No. It is typical for more than one bank to be chosen. One bank will be the lead advisor (also called "Global coordinator/GCs") which is us. The others (2-3 banks) will play a supporting role (called "Joint Bookrunners/JBRs"). Since we are the lead bank, we will drive the process. The JBRs will come in where we need them, usually towards the latter half of the process when we are marketing the IPO to many institutional investors. So the number of JBRs on a deal depends on the size of the IPO. A larger IPO size means marketing to more investors and hence needs more manpower/banks. The oil company Saudi Aramco for example hired more than 9 banks when it was planning its $100B IPO. TinyPanda is expected to be a billion-dollar IPO at least. Hence the need for 2 other banks."

"So isn't that a good thing for us? Our work reduces because of the division of labour"

"Nah. Because even the fee gets split between the banks. So you know already that the IPO fee is around 2-3% of the IPO deal size. That % doesn't increase when there are more banks. It just gets split among the banks. We as the lead bank get the largest share but it still sucks to lose some share to those idiots at S&S."

Anil was taking a mental note of all the things he had just learned when Bala's desk phone rang. He knew the meeting was up. Anil excused himself and walked out of the office to the grunt work that awaited him now that they had got the IPO mandate.

> *Theory time. Bala here again. I already bored that useless Anil with a lot of gyaan (he's definitely not getting a full-time offer). But I want to bore you as well.*
> 
> *Understanding the structure of investments banks and what all services they offer is critical to understanding the IPO process better. So here's a quick explainer.*
> 
> ***Investment banks fall into two buckets.***
> 
> 1.  *The really big investment banks called “**bulge-bracket banks**”. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citi, and Barclays are global examples. In India, you have the investment banking arms of banks like SBI and Kotak.*
>     
> 2.  *The smaller investment banks called “**boutique banks**” like Cantor Fitzgerald in the US and O3 capital in India.*
>     
> 
> *Bulge-bracket investment banks are typically preferred in an IPO because of the broader range of services they offer compared to boutique banks. This is also the primary difference between the two. Bulge-bracket banks have a suite of offerings that broadly fall under 4 divisions.*
> 
> ***1\. Investment banking division** - While they are called investment banks, technically, investment banking is one division inside them. This division offers advisory services when a company want to buy or sell itself to another company (mergers & acquisitions) and when a company wants to raise funds from the market (capital markets). An IPO falls in the latter category. The teams here mostly work on valuing companies, creating pitches (like in RFPs) and executing the deals (IPOs, mergers, etc)  
> **2\. Sales & trading division** - The sales part of this division are mostly on the phone trying to convince institutional investors to buy shares of a company they think is good. If a client ends up saying yes, the trading part of the division comes in. The traders actually punch in the order on the computer and execute the buy or sell order. Zerodha and Robinhood are for retail investors like you and me to buy/sell shares. Institutional investors and hedge funds use the trading division of these banks to execute large buy/sell orders.  
> **3\. Equity research division** - This division publishes the reports on companies that rate the companies' stock as either buy or sell or hold.  
> **4\. Asset management division** - This division typically takes money from very very rich people and invests that in different places with the aim of maximizing returns. They are managing the assets of these rich people and hence the name.*
> 
> *There are more services offered by each of the divisions but I have covered only the most important ones.*
> 
> *In contrast, boutique banks usually have only the investment banking division. **An IPO requires the services of the first three divisions and hence the preference for bulge brackets**. So bulge-bracket banks also include details like the global reach of their sales division and the depth of experience of their equity research division in the RFP pitch. These matter for the IPO.*
> 
> *In our story, you can see that the investment banking division has already come into play - they are the ones who deal with the RFPs. We will see the role of the other divisions later as the story progresses.*
> 
> *Before we jump back into the story, another quick point about the **IPO fee**.*
> 
> *2-3% of the IPO deal size as fee might seem small but actually are a money-maker for banks. 2% of a $1 billion IPO translated to $20 million. And given a team of around 5-6 people from a bank work on it for around 3 months (cumulatively across different weeks of different months), it comes to around $1 million per employee per month.*
> 
> *This obviously gets lower when there are multiple banks involved. The lead bank could get 50% of the $20 million while the 2 JBRs get 25% each. The % share is different for each deal based on how much work is allocated to each bank. But say, even at $500K per employee for just one deal, it is profitable for the bank.*
> 
> *Geography too determines the fee. IPOs in the US cost anywhere between 2-5%. Europe is around 1-3%. Asia (including India) costs as low as 0.75% to max 2%. The stock exchange where you are listing will determine the geography - best to choose a bank that has a strong presence there. However, you can market the IPO share to investors across the globe and not of that country alone. So you will also need a bank that has a global reach. Again, another reason why bulge-bracket banks are preferred.*

Oooh, this is getting long. Take a break. Get coffee. Popcorn. Whatever. Just come back quick because I am insecure about you leaving the piece mid-way. Really, please come back.

## Step 4: Kick-off Meeting and Due Diligence

There was a lot of bustle in the TinyPanda office that day. More than 20 people had crammed into the conference room for the official IPO kick-off meeting. There was Founder Lata and her CFO, the investors and the bankers from all the banks involved. There were also the auditors and lawyers who had just been chosen.

Only the 20 odd people gathered in this room knew that TinyPanda had officially started preparing for an IPO. No one outside this room knew. No one else was supposed to know. This was a highly confidential process and everyone was covered by non-disclosure agreements. The term for such a group working on a confidential IPO process is, and clap for the creative name here, the "working group".

**3 hours later...**

Lata yawned as she walked out of the conference room to get a cup of coffee. She could have asked the assistant but she needed a break. This meeting was taking forever. They had been discussing the potential timelines of the IPO, what registration forms to file with the regulators and deciding who does what. As soon as they would settle on a timeline, one of the bankers or lawyers would point out a problem and the discussion would start all over again. It was frustrating but Lata also knew this was necessary. The kick-off meeting, however, would end soon. It was what came after that Lata was dreading - due diligence.

During the due diligence (DD) phase, the bankers, auditors and lawyers would dig deep into the company - to check if everything is as they say it is. Over 4-6 weeks, Auditors would pour over the financial statements of the company (profit & loss statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement). Bankers call customers and do reference checks. Lawyers check if all the necessary corporate governance systems are in place as required by law for a company going public. And Lata would have to be available at all times to answer questions and fix any gap that might be uncovered during the DD phase. And she had to do all this while continuing to run and grow the company. The next few months were going to be hard but she had weathered much harder times. She was going to get through this. She had to if taking TinyPanda public would help create a foundation for the company to last decades.

With renewed enthusiasm and a cup of steaming coffee in hand, Lata headed back to the conference room.

## Step 5: Preparing the S-1

Due diligence began right after the kick-off meeting. No time to waste if they had to meet the timeline of listing within the next 6 months as decided in the meeting. In parallel to the DD, the bankers and lawyers got to preparing the S-1.

> *Hey hey hey, your boy Bala here. Sorry for breaking your flow but need to give a quick bit of info about S-1 here.*
> 
> *A US company planning to list its shares on a US stock exchange has to file the S-1 form with the regulator SEC or Securities Exchange Commission. The S-1 is a 300-600 page long document that covers various bits of information about the company like what it does, the risks it faces, its financial statements, management details, the IPO details and company ownership structure. The format of the S-1 is pre-defined by the SEC so that the company discloses all information that is necessary for future investors to take an educated call on whether to invest in that company. The SEC gives a nod to the company to go ahead with its IPO plans only after thoroughly checking the S-1.*
> 
> *Here is [Uber's S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519103850/d647752ds1.htm) if you want to take look at what the document looks like.*
> 
> ***The S-1 filing is also the first time the company's plans to IPO are made public**. You and I, the media, anyone can download the S-1 from SEC's website. The company is also legally required to follow up the S-1 filing with an official press release stating its intention to IPO. Up to the S-1 filing, only the working group, as mentioned earlier, are aware of the IPO plans (unless the founders announced the plans in public beforehand which happens sometimes).*
> 
> *A foreign company listing its shares on a US stock exchange has to file the F-1 form., which is like the S-1 but with additional questions around taxation and litigation since the company is from another country.*
> 
> *In India, the SEC equivalent is the SEBI or Securities Exchange Board of India. And companies wanting to list on an Indian exchange have to file the Draft Offer Document. The content is more or less the same as the S-1. It just goes by a different name.*
> 
> *It is the S-1/Draft Offer document that eventually becomes the prospectus.*
> 
> *Back to the story.*

Lata was swamped with work as she had expected. Over and above the time she has to put into DD, Lata also had to work long hours with Bala and Raj to figure out the narrative, ie, how best to explain the company and the industry in the S-1 to make it exciting for investors. The rest of the details to be filled in the S-1 had been split between the lawyers, bankers and TinyPanda's finance team.

Lata was also in for a surprise when Bala one day told her to be prepared for the Analyst meeting. They were 2 months into the S-1 preparation and was confused about this new step. Bala explained that public companies generally have reports published about them by analysts from the equity research division (remember the 4 divisions of investment banking). For example, the analyst of Snapchat at JP Murugan's equity research division published a 2-3 page report every quarter when Snapchat releases its financial performance for that quarter. And at the end of that report, they have a 'buy the share' or 'hold the share' or 'sell the share' recommendation. But when a company is going public for the first time, there are no such reports about the company available. So the equity analysts like to do an Initiating Coverage Report (ICR) which is a bit more detailed (70 to 100 pages). Unlike the S-1 which is created by TinyPanda itself, the ICR is written by the analysts. It is their own opinion of TinyPanda and they are free to rate TinyPanda's shares as a buy or a sell. This is important going forward in the IPO process since investors can also look at a 3rd party's opinion about TinyPanda apart from reading TinyPanda's S-1.

> *Hey, Bala again. A small bit of trivia here.*
> 
> *Getting these analysts involved in the IPO process is actually a huge legal process. The investment banking divisions in all banks work inside what is called a 'Chinese Wall'. They are cut off from the rest of the 3 divisions since they deal with highly private and confidential information like who is going to IPO soon and who is acquiring whom. This information cannot be passed on to colleagues in the other 3 divisions since they can use that confidential information to game the stock market (which is a criminal act called 'insider trading'). So all banks have legal & compliance teams who ensure no emails are exchanged between investment banking and other divisions without prior permission.  
> For TinyPanda’s IPO, I had to separately apply for permission with the compliance team at JP Murugan specifying exactly which research analyst I want to cross over the Chinese Wall. And post permission, all the emails and calls between me and the research analyst are mediated by the compliance team.*

Lata understood Bala's point about the ICR report providing a 3rd party opinion. It was more work for her but this was too, like everything else, important. So an 'analyst day' was arranged and the research analysts from all the 3 banks JP Murugan, S&S, and Bakarwaleys came down to question her and the CFO about the company's performance and future plans. This Q&A session would lay the groundwork for their reports. It was a gruelling 4-hour session. The analysts were ruthless but Lata was glad at the end of it. One because it was over and two, because the analysts seem satisfied with her answers.

**4 months since the kick-off meeting. A day before the S-1 filing...**

Lata was sitting at her desk in an upbeat mood. This was it. The S-1 had taken 3 months to complete. And it would be uploaded on SEC's website tomorrow. This also meant the media and the public get to officially know about TinyPanda's IPO plans tomorrow. Lata was looking forward to the burst of PR that would follow the next few weeks. It would be good for the company.

Technically, the S-1 was not entirely complete. While most of the sections were filled, few important details related to the IPO were not yet finalized. Like how many shares of the company would be offered in the IPO and at what price. They also were yet to decide how many shares Raj and the other investors would sell in the IPO. But that was okay. SEC/SEBI allowed a company to file the S-1/Offer document and add these details later. This was the general practice since the final number of shares and price would only be decided a day or two before the share actually started trading on the stock exchange.

What was decided in the S-1 though was that TinyPanda would list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the stock label "TINY" (called the ticker). Lata was very clear from the beginning that they had to list on the NYSE. She also liked the ticker TINY since it was a play on what they did, ie, compress data. Luckily the label was available and she hoped SEC would approve it.

As Lata smiled at herself, feeling clever for coming up with the ticker name, the computer screen in front of her lit up. A new email had landed in her inbox. As she read the email, her smile disappeared. It was from a familiar name. And this email was sent as a continuation of a conversation that was more than a year old. Fumbling, she pulled out her phone and called Investor Raj. He too had received the email. In an urgent tone, she said "Let's call for an emergency meeting. I think.....I think we might have to put the IPO plans on hold. Or maybe even call it off."

-   *Founder Lata and Investor Raj got the board's permission to prepare for TinyPanda's IPO*
    
-   *Banker Bala and 2 other investment banks were chosen to advise on the IPO*
    
-   *Post the IPO kick-off meeting, due diligence was done and the S-1 was prepared over 4 months.*
    
-   *Just one day before the S-1 was to be filed, Lata got an email that made her consider halting the IPO process.*
    

*Onto Part 2...*

## Emergency Board Meeting

There were 7 people seated in a conference room at the TinyPanda Office in pin-drop silence. It was late in the evening - an unusual hour for a board of directors meeting. Lata cleared her throat to break the silence and draw attention to herself. What she was going to say in the next 15 minutes were extremely important. It could change the course of TinyPanda's journey.

**Earlier that day...**

Lata had received an email from Guru, the founder and CEO of Gooli, making an offer to acquire TinyPanda. Gooli was a data storage company that sold its software to corporates. Like Dropbox or Google Drive, companies could store their data online on Gooli and pay based on the amount of data stored. Gooli was interested in acquiring TinyPanda, specifically their data compression algorithm, to make their offering more attractive to customers. While TinyPanda actually reduced the amount of data stored through compression, effectively cannibalizing the revenue of Gooli in the short term, it could help Gooli cut down prices and capture a larger market share than competitors in the long term.

**Gooli Guru**, as the tech industry called him, and his team had initiated the first acquisition conversation more than a year ago. Talks fell through as Raj, Lata and a few other investors felt TinyPanda was being undervalued. But this latest email from Guru offered 3 times more than what they were offering last time.

Lata was very clear that even a 3x higher offer did not make sense. TinyPanda could be a much bigger company if it continued to be independent. But TinyPanda wasn't a founder-led company anymore where she could single-handedly take the decision. She had to run this acquisition offer by the board of directors and then collectively decide to accept or reject the offer. Lata's only way ahead was to convince the board to choose an IPO over an acquisition.

There was another point that jumped at Lata. Tripling the offer seemed like a last-ditch attempt by Guru to acquire TinyPanda. This meant Guru had somehow caught wind of TinyPanda's IPO plans even though it was not yet public. Someone within the 'working group' had leaked the news to Guru. But Lata couldn't do much about the leak. At least not at this moment. There were more pressing matters at hand.

The email also meant Guru knew they are planning to file the S-1 tomorrow. If Lata pushed the date of the S-1 filing by even a day, Guru will know TinyPanda is considering the acquisition offer. And he might offer more attractive valuations making her job of convincing the board for an IPO tougher. Lata had to call for a board meeting today!

Typically if Lata had requested the board members for a meeting with just 6 hours notice, it would never have happened. But she knew when they heard the reason for today's meeting, they would make it. They had to.

**Back to the present.**

Lata had just finished giving a 15-minute passionate speech about why the best route ahead for TinyPanda was to IPO and not be acquired by Gooli. This was followed by a half-an-hour discussion and it was now time for the vote.

Lata had to get 4 of the 7 votes to win. She knew she already had 3 of them - her own vote, Raj's, and the other venture capitalist's votes. They had stuck with her all these years and believed in her larger vision. The problem was the remaining 4 board members. There were all independent directors hired recently.

Independent directors, typically business or industry experts, were members who weren't involved closely with the running of the business. A company adds independent directors on the board to give a more unbiased opinion on how the founders and executives were running the company and check for discrepancies in management. Lata and Raj had added these 4 independent directors over the last year as they prepared for the IPO. Having a majority of independent directors on the board (4 out of 7 here) sent a strong signal to investors ahead of the IPO that the company had proper checks in place to ensure there is no fraud (as discussed in part 1 - this is part of strengthening corporate governance before an IPO ).

As the voting began, Lata prayed that at least one of the independent directors voted in favour of an IPO.

> ***Hello, Bala here.** Did you miss me? Come on, don't act all cool. I know you did.*
> 
> *Quick trivia here. Swooping in and acquiring a company just before it IPOs is rare but has happened a few times. A famous example being Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics just before it could IPO in 2017. Literally just before it IPO-ed. The acquisition was finalized and announced just one day before AppDynamic's shares were supposed to start trading.*
> 
> *In fact, a few companies follow a 'dual-track process' where the investment banks are helping the company prepare for an IPO while in parallel, they are also looking for potential acquirers. AppDynamics was not a dual-track process but they still chose an acquisition over an IPO when the offer came along.*

## Step 6: Filing the S-1

It was late in the evening and Lata seemed a bit relaxed. The S-1 had gone out a few hours ago as originally scheduled. A few leading media outlets had already picked up the news. It was still too early but the reception had been positive.

The IPO schedule was back on track after the board vote last evening had gone better than expected. 2 of the independent directors had voted in favour of an IPO giving her a total of 5 votes out of 7. There was no email from Gooli Guru but she knew he would be fuming in his office, figuring out another devious way to stop the IPO.

Now that the S-1 had been filed, the 20-day cooling-off period (30 days in India where you file with SEBI) had begun. The regulator would use this time to check the S-1 before permitting the IPO to move ahead.

During this period, Lata and the banking team would have to be on standby, ready to submit any additional information the regulator might ask.

> ***Few additional points about the timeline.***
> 
> *Typically, Lata and her team have to respond to the regulator within 1-2 days and file the new information under the heading 'S-1 Amendments'. An important point to note here is that SEC/SEBI only checks if any key piece of information is missing in the S-1. They don't check for the factual accuracy of the information submitted. That check would have happened in the due diligence phase earlier in the process.*
> 
> *This 20 day period is also the minimum. Sometimes, the back and forth between the company and SEC could take longer.*
> 
> *Also, the company need not start the roadshow right after the approval is received for various reasons - the holiday season, sudden events like covid, market sentiment changes, etc. Although, it is advisable to start immediately.*

## Step 7: Pre-deal Investor Education (PDIE)

The next few weeks were going to be hectic for Bala. During the cool-off period, the company (ie, Founder Lata and the other executives) was prohibited from advertising the shares of TinyPanda to any potential investors and collecting orders for the same. However, the bankers were allowed to talk to potential investors and try to judge interest. This step is called the "Pre-deal investor education" or PDIE.

For this reason, Bala had asked the equity research analysts (the ones who wrote the ICRs) of all the 3 advising banks to assemble. A small equity sales team (2-4 people from the sales & trading division of the investment bank) were also to join in. Like the equity research team, the equity sales team had been crossed over the Chinese Wall by Bala after taking permission from JP Murugan's compliance team.

> *If you notice, 3 divisions of the investment banks are now fully involved in the IPO process. As mentioned in Part 1, this is why bulge bracket banks are preferred as lead advisors.*

Bala had gotten the syndicate team (another team within the investment banking division) to prepare a list of potential institutional investors who would be interested in this IPO. The syndicate team were the investor facing side of the investment banking division. They regularly kept in touch with institutional investors and had in-depth profiles of them - who bought which recent IPO, are they the ones who place large orders, which sectors are they focused on, etc.

Over the next 2 weeks, the equity research analysts would have face to face meetings with a few of the institutional investors on this list and answer any questions the investors had about the company after reading the S-1 (which was public now). Bala's team had already prepared the detailed day-to-day schedule for each of these research analysts. Each analyst would meet a different investor so maximum ground can be covered.

In parallel, the equity sales team will follow up with these investors after the meetings to ask what they thought about the company and collect indications of interest (IoIs). IoIs aren't binding, ie, the investor can later say they are not interested anymore. But they are helpful for the banks to judge if there is enough interest among investors to buy shares in the IPO.

Another important bit of information collected from investors at this point is their valuation of the company. The indicative valuations from all these investors are aggregated by Bala's team and compared with the valuation that the bankers themselves had calculated. They then arrive at a middle ground and come up with a valuation range.

**At the end of PDIE**

After inputs from 2 weeks of PDIE, Bala's team arrived at a valuation range of $3.9 to $4.5 billion for TinyPanda.

The next step was to finalize how many shares would be offered in the IPO. Bala had to balance multiple interests here.

One was to meet the criteria of the stock exchange which typically revolve around 2 parameters. One - to ensure enough shares are listed (so that enough trading can happen). Two - to ensure the market value of the shares is high enough so that only decently large companies are listed. The NYSE, where TinyPanda planned to list, needed a minimum of 1.1 million shares to be listed with a collective market value of at least $100 million. (The BSE in India needs the shares offered in IPO to be valued at a minimum of ₹10 crores and the company's overall valuation to be at least ₹25 crores).

> *Every stock exchange has its own set of eligibility criteria for listing. It is also possible for a company to list on 2 stock exchanges in an IPO. In that case, it has to ensure it meets the listing criteria of both exchanges. Also, these stock exchanges can be in 2 different countries as well.*

Another was to meet the demands of all TinyPanda investors who wanted to sell their shares in the IPO. Like Raj, VCs who invested early usually want to sell most or all of their shares. Later stage investors (either VC or private equity) and the founders will sell only a small part of their shares. In fact, it can send out a wrong signal to the market if founders and late-stage investors sell a lot of their shares in an IPO - that there's something wrong with the business and the people running/owning it are dumping their shares. Bala also had to take into consideration the shares a few employees might want to sell in the IPO.

The third interest Bala had to keep in mind was if TinyPanda wanted to issue any new shares in the IPO. The money from selling these shares would not go to any investor. It would go into the company's coffers to be used for growing the business. It was advisable to have at least a small % of the shares as new shares as a signal to the market that this IPO was not just about investors exiting the company.

Lata, Raj and the other investors already had a fair idea of how much % of their shares they wanted to sell. It was basis this along with their own valuation of TinyPanda that they decided 3 banks were enough to advise on the IPO. Bala just had to sit down with all of them and finalize the exact number. And he did that on the last of PDIE. In a meeting of the founder, investors and bankers, the following was decided.

TinyPanda currently had 30 million shares. 20% of them (6 million secondary shares) would be sold in the IPO. And another 1 million fresh shares (or primary shares) would be offered in the IPO, the money from which, will go towards helping TinyPanda grow even faster.

So the end result would be 31 million total shares of TinyPanda. And 7 million of them (22.5% of the company) will be listed on the stock exchange (these 7M shares are called free-float shares).

The valuation range of $3.9 to $4.5 billion divided by 31 million shares translated to a price range of $125 to $145 per share. And the expected IPO size would be in the range of $875M - $1B (7M shares multiplied by price range).

The standard lock-up of 180 days would apply to everyone. This meant anyone investor or founder selling their shares in this IPO could not sell any more of their shares for the next 180 days. This clause is a standard in all IPOs, again, to ensure someone does not go dumping all their shares in quick instalments over the next few weeks. Something that could send a negative signal to the market.

"Great! The S-1 will be updated with these numbers and the next stage could begin", Lata thought to herself, silently glad the meeting had ended. To her, selling her own shares was not fun to discuss. But her train of thought was broken by Bala who was saying

"One last thing. We'll keep the greenshoe at the standard 15%"

"Sure. I mean, do we have a choice?" Lata laughed and left the room.

> ***Hey hey hey, Bala here. Time for an interesting topic - the greenshoe option.***
> 
> *And to understand this, we first need to understand the concept of 'underwriting' which means the act of taking on someone else's risk. So when an insurer sells you an insurance policy, they agree to cover for you when a 'risk' occurs (death in case of life insurance). Hence, they have underwritten you.*
> 
> *In the case of an IPO, the bankers don't just act as advisors but also underwriters. So when we say TinyPanda is offering 7 million shares in its IPO to investors, what is effectively happening behind the scenes is the bankers (3 banks in this case) are buying the 7 million shares from TinyPanda and selling it to investors. Bankers then collect the money from investors, take their cut (2-5% as explained in Part 1) and pass the rest on to TinyPanda.*
> 
> *We wankers, sorry, bankers do this as a way to show our clients that we are committed to selling every share in the IPO to the best of our abilities. Because if we don't, we suffer the loss.*
> 
> *Now coming to the greenshoe. Once a share starts trading on the stock exchange, if it falls below the IPO price, the SEC and SEBI actually allow the bankers to intervene and stop the share price from falling. Bankers do this by buying the said shares, thus increasing demand and stopping the price from falling further. It's like gaming the stock market but legal. But they can't do it whenever they want. They can only do it during the 30 day period after the share lists. This price stabilization mechanism is called greenshoe.*
> 
> *How does it work exactly?*
> 
> *Let's continue TinyPanda's example. There are 7M shares on offer in the IPO. This means the bankers are buying 7M shares from TinyPanda's shareholders and selling them to the IPO investors. The bankers then decide to sell additional shares, over and above these 7M shares - these are the shares they will buy back later if the trading price falls below IPO price. SEC/SEBI allow for the size of this additional lot to be 15% of the normal offering. So in TinyPanda's case, 1.05 million greenshoe shares (15% x 7M shares).*
> 
> *But where will the bankers get these additional 1.05M shares? They borrow (not buy) them from some of the existing investors who still have some shares left in the company even after the IPO. Bankers then sell all these 8.05M shares (7M + 1.05M) in the IPO at offer price, let's say, $150. This process is nothing but allocation and is explained later in the story.*
> 
> *The money received from these 1.05M shares is kept in a separate account. To the IPO investor, it doesn't matter whether they are getting a normal share or a greenshoe share. It's all the same to them. Once the share starts trading, there are 2 scenarios.*
> 
> ***Scenario 1: Share price goes above $150**  
> If the share price largely stays above $150 in the next 30 days, the bankers don't need to use the greenshoe. In this case, the money in the separate account is transferred to the investors whose shares they borrowed. And their shares are marked as 'sold' in the IPO.*
> 
> ***Scenario 2: Share price goes below $150**  
> Imagine the share price drops to $120 and continues falling. Bankers use the money in the separate account to start buying back shares. As they keep placing orders at increasing prices, they hope the price fall will stop and slowly bounce back. If they buy back all the 1.05M shares, they return them to the shareholders they originally borrowed them from. Since they bought these 1.05M shares at a lower price than $150 (which they received for the shares), any remaining amount in this account can be kept by the bank as profit. If they ended up buying only part of the shares before the price got stabilized and 30 days got over, only those bought back are returned and the remaining are marked as sold. Scenario 2 doesn't apply when the share price falls below $150 for a little time and then bounces back. It applies only when the price consistently stays below or keeps falling with time.*
> 
> *OK. Back to the story.*

The S-1 was updated with the number of shares on offer (7M), greenshoe shares (1.05M), and the lock-up period. The only information missing in this version is the price at which the IPO shares will be offered (called, no prizes for guessing, "offer price"). Along with the S-1 update, a press release goes out announcing the price range for the IPO.

## Step 8: Roadshow & Book-building

Lata took a deep breath and walked into the room. The roadshow booklets - printed versions of the 30 slides deck made by Bala's team - were already distributed to everyone present. Lata and her CFO spent the next hour presenting and answering questions to the team from one of the largest institutional investors in the US - BrownRock. Within 5 minutes of the meeting ending, she was in the car to her next meeting where the hour-long drill would repeat.

Lata was just 2 days into a 10-day roadshow and was already feeling completely exhausted. Speaking for an hour in 5 meetings every day was no joke. Add to this, the travel. Not just from one part of New York to another. She also had to fly to Boston and San Francisco for investor meetings.

The one thing that kept her going was the report that Bala's team sent her at the end of every day. It summarized the number of orders placed by investors till now and how much % of the IPO's shares were already subscribed.

You see, the book-building phase, where the bankers start accepting orders (or "building the order book"), had started concurrently with the roadshow and was going to last as long as the roadshow. After a roadshow meeting, institutional investors pinged the equity syndicate team with the number of shares they were interested in buying and at what price. And these orders were keyed into an application that bankers use to keep track of orders. Remember, at this stage, the orders are just collected. Allotment of these shares to investors happens later.

Also, the price at which orders came in had to be between the price range which would have been announced at the start of the roadshow, ie, $125-$145. And in a typical auction style, if an investor wants to increase their chances of getting the shares, they have to put in the order at a higher price. They can also keep revising orders (both the number of shares and price) until the book was closed. Given 2 days of the roadshow were already done, the book would close in 8 more days.

Orders could come in from any qualified institutional investor, whether they were met during the PDIE/Roadshow or not.

At the end of Day 2, TinyPanda's book had already crossed the 50% mark, ie, orders had been placed for more than 50% of the 8.05M shares. This was a very encouraging sign and showed that investors were very interested in the shares.

On Day 5, as Lata was in San Francisco meeting investors, she got a call from Bala with Raj conferenced in. The book had just crossed the 100% mark with most orders coming in at the upper end of the price range. Bala suggested they move the price range upwards to $145-$155, meaning the valuation would now be in the range of $4.5B-$4.7B Given the high demand, there was a good chance most investors would revise their orders to a higher price once the news of a price revision went out.

Lata did not have an objection obviously. This was excellent news. She smiled as she walked into her 3rd meeting of the day.

## Step 9: Pricing & Allocation

Bala cleared his throat and then looked at himself in the washroom mirror. He had to speak a lot at tonight's meeting that was going to start in an hour. This was it. The entire IPO process boiled down to this one meeting.

Earlier in the evening, the 10-day roadshow had come to an end with Lata and her team meeting more than 40 institutional investors. There was a rush of orders in the last hour - a few investors adding more shares, a few of them increasing the price they were willing to pay - resulting in the book being subscribed 230%, ie, the demand was 2.3x times the number of shares on offer.

With the order book closed, it was now time for the allocation meeting that would run the entire night. Bala mentally ran through what he had to do in the meeting.

First, he had to finalize the offer price. This was the easy part. The orders received had to be sorted by price, from highest to lowest. Then the no. of shares from each row were added, starting from the top. The price in the row at which they reach a total of 8.05 million shares would be the offer price. The logic was, at this price, there were enough people willing to buy all the shares on offer.

Now for the tough part - allocation, ie, who gets how many shares. It never was "who bid the highest gets the shares". Bala. knew they had to consider the profile of the investor. There were largely two types of institutional investors → Long-only Funds (LO) and Hedge Funds (HF).

Long-only funds were investors who bought shares for the long term. They weren't the kind of people who bought and then sold immediately. Since they mostly only bought shares (buying a share is called 'going long' on the share), they were called long-only. Asset management companies like Vanguard and Fidelity in the US and a few mutual fund companies in India fall under this category. Even pension funds and insurance companies that have truckloads of money to manage for decades fall in this category. In India, LIC would fall in this category.

Hedge funds on the other hand are those interested in shares where they can make again as quickly as possible. They are speculators and typically try to take advantage of events like an IPO, merger, some major news, etc that could swing share prices. Citadel and Millenium are well-known names in the US.

Bala had to ensure a reasonable split between long-only funds and hedge funds. The reason being this - If all shares went to long-only funds, most wouldn't sell and the share would hardly trade on the stock exchange after listing. And if all shares went to hedge funds, there would be random buying and selling (because of the speculation) and the share would experience massive swings in price which is not good. Over time, bankers had figured out that allocating at least 60-70% of the shares to long-only funds and 30-40% to hedge funds was a well-balanced strategy that gave enough leeway for the shares to be traded (since many HFs would sell) but also ensure price stability (since many LOs would hold).

There was another interest Bala had to keep in mind. He had to ensure a few of his (or JP Murugan's) 'friendly' investors got the allocation they wanted. This was important because keeping them happy would ensure they would also place orders in future IPOs Bala would advise. Bala had to do this without making it obvious. The usual sell was 'that particular investor is a quality one - having them as a shareholder is a good signal to the rest of the market'. Usually, there wasn't a lot of convincing to do since the result would be the same for Lata, Raj, and the other VCs selling their shares in the IPO. All their shares would still be sold at the offer price and they would make quite a lot of money. But sometimes, there would be arguments if VCs like Raj and the other bankers on the IPO had some favourite institutional investors.

"Ok, this was going to be alright. After all, I have done this multiple times already", Bala thought as he made his way to the meeting room. Lata, Raj, and the other bankers on the IPO were already seated. This was going to be a long night.

> ***In India, the IPO roadshow and allocation happen quite differently.***
> 
> *The roadshow happens and then the book is thrown open, unlike the US/UK/Europe where they both happen concurrently. Because of this, the book is also kept open for a shorter period - around 4-6 days.*
> 
> *The biggest difference is in how shares are allocated. In US/UK/Europe, all the shares on offer are allocated to institutional investors (LOs and HFs). Very rarely, a company explicitly decides to reserve a small % (usually 5%) for retail investors (you and me). Even then, most of the retail portion gets eaten up by super-rich people who have access to people who can help them get the allocation. There is a small change coming in the US though. Robinhood, an app that lets you buy/sell shares in the US, is working on bringing a small % of shares in US IPOs to retail investors.*
> 
> *In India, SEBI mandates that 35% of IPO's shares be reserved for retail investors (in the case of loss-making companies IPO-ing, the retail reservation is 10%). Another 15% goes to super-rich folks (who have to invest a minimum of ₹2 lakhs). And 50% is reserved for institutional investors (called qualified institutional investors or QIBs). While bankers and founders decide who gets the allocation in the institutional investor segment, they have no say in the retail investor segment. If the retail portion is over-subscribed, allocation happens on a lucky draw basis, ie, names are randomly selected and everyone is given equal numbers of shares. Because of this, the allocation also happens over a few days after the book is closed. Whereas in the US, the allocation happens the same night the book is closed.*
> 
> *As a retail investor, the more an IPO is oversubscribed, the lower your chances of getting an allotment. Also, if you didn't get allotted, there's actually still a chance you might have a piece of the IPO if one of the mutual funds you invest in or the insurance company you have a policy with have invested in the IPO via the institutional investor route.*
> 
> *Last point. If the book is not filled, the IPO is usually called off as the company is deemed not good enough to be a public company yet.*

## Step 10: Trading begins

The allocation meeting had gone smoothly the previous night. The IPO was priced at the top of the range ($155) making the IPO size $1.25B, among the largest that year. The SEC filing and press release about the final price and number of shares had gone out immediately late at night. The stage was set for the share 'TINY' to start trading today.

Founder Lata and a few members of TinyPanda's management, Raj and a few other VCs, Bala and a few other bankers were all assembled at the NYSE. In a few minutes, Lata would ring the bell to mark the opening of trading at the NYSE. This was a ceremony that IPO-ing companies typically did. It made for a good marketable and PR moment. It was Bala's idea and he had managed to reserve the slot for TinyPanda by paying a fee to NYSE.

Lata was excited and nervous at the same time. And surprisingly, it wasn't about all the cameras pointed at her face. It was about what price the TinyPanda shares would open at when the trading begins right after she rings the bell. The opening price could be higher (or lower) than the offer price ($155) based on how positively (or negatively) the market (the rest of the investors) viewed the company.

**30 minutes after trading opened...**

TinyPanda's share price was already 25% above the offer price and didn't seem to be slowing. Raj should have been happy given the positive reception but he wasn't. He looked at Bala and gave a forced smile. The bloody banker had once again managed to under-price the IPO. Typically, if the share price jumps very high compared to the offer price, it means the bankers could have decided on a higher offer price for the IPO but got too conservative. While the jump in share price is good for the company in general, it is seen as a loss by investors like Raj who sold their shares in the IPO. They could have gotten more money for the same shares.

Bala smiled back at Raj knowing very well what Raj's smile had meant. He didn't give a shit as long as he made money. What irked him a bit though was the way TinyPanda's trading price spiked and held at that high level. He had a feeling it was not going to drop below the offer price in the next 30 days. This meant they didn't need to buy back the greenshoe shares which would have made more money for Bala.

Having nothing more to do here, Bala began to make his way to the NYSE exit when his phone buzzed. It was a message from Gooli Guru.

"You should've pushed for an acquisition. Anyway, congrats on the IPO", the message read.

Bala was the leak.

**\*The End\***

## A few parting thoughts

The IPO is just one route among the three to take a company public. The other 2 routes are Direct Listing and Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACS (In India, there's no other route apart from IPO).

The IPO route has its pros and cons. The pro is that you have bankers who will advise you throughout, take on risks, and use their investor connections to ensure the IPO shares are bought.

The con is it is pretty costly (we discussed the fee in Part 1). But that's the more obvious con. The subtler con is that the IPO route tends to underprice the company. That's because the bankers are trying to balance the interests of the company IPO-ing as well as the institutional investors putting money into the IPO. And bankers have a strong incentive to appease institutional investors since they will come back for the next IPO the bank is advising. So they tend to agree to a lower valuation the institutional investor suggests. Or try to include the investor during allocation. I am not saying this always happens but the scenario is conducive for this happening.

Take the example of Snowflake, a cloud services company that IPO-ed in the US in 2020. The share price on the first day of trading jumped 112% which meant the investors exiting the IPO [left $3.8B on the table](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/snowflakes-first-day-pop-means-ipo-left-3point8-billion-on-the-table-the-most-in-12-years.html). This has been quite a common occurrence in the last few years resulting in prominent venture capitalists like Bill Gurley being very vocal against the current IPO process and pushing companies to consider direct listing instead.

In the direct listing route, bankers don't have a say in the valuation and allocation. Investors bid on shares like in an auction and are allotted on a first come first serve basis. Companies like Slack and Spotify are recent examples of companies that chose direct listing over traditional IPO. But the direct listing process again has its pros and cons. And hence few people prefer the SPAC route.

However, I will not go into details of direct listing and SPACs here since this piece is already too long (lol). I will take your leave with this short comic strip (meme strip??)
