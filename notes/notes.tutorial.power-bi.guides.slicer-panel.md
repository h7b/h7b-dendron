# Customize a slicer panel

ref: [How to Power BI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaOG42ic2wI)

Build a slicer panel. How to integrate a bookmark navigator to deal with a large number of slicers and to bring structure. Then we have a closer look at how to visualize the applied filters and how we can highlight the slicers that have a filter in place.

- Assemble slicer by groups
- Use the bookmark features to show/hide only each group
- Insert a button for each "bookmark navigator", so end user can click
- use "DAX Studio". Copy the DAX functions from "Filter Dump Measure (All tables)". Paste into Power BI as a new measure to display the contents of the applied filters
