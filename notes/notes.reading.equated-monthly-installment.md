## Notes from reading

- An equated monthly installment (EMI) is a type of payment made by borrowers to lenders on a monthly basis in a fixed amount. 
- EMIs include both the interest and principal amounts. 
- After a certain number of EMIs are made, the loan will be fully paid off.

### Reducing-Balance Method
$$
\boxed{A=P*\frac {r(1+r)^n} {(1+r)^n-1}}
$$

where
- A = Periodic EMI amount
- P = Principal borrowed
- r = Periodic interest rate (annual interest rate/12)
- n = Total number of payment (number of months during the loan tenure)

> NOTE: the period can be month, year or whatever equal period you can imagine. Just make the appropriate change for `r` and `n`

> NOTE: Or simply use **PMT** function in *Excel*. Try this [example spreadsheet](https://app.box.com/s/pfkwtannn6jd89qqagayrcxac3kvhjw8)
