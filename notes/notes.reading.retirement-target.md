## Notes from reading

how to calculate the amount of money they’ll need to have saved up before they can retire?

- [Determine Your Spending Needs](https://hyp.is/OiEwAjxNEeypO9v5pruzqw/docdrop.org/epub/Investing-Made-Simple_-Index-Fu---Mike-Piper-l6y6s.epub/?loc=text/part0013.html)
    - how much you will have to withdraw from your portfolio each year during retirement
- [Multiply by 25](https://hyp.is/Un3VujxNEey1B9cbCvhmRQ/docdrop.org/epub/Investing-Made-Simple_-Index-Fu---Mike-Piper-l6y6s.epub/?loc=text/part0013.html)
    - We multiply by 25 because multiple studies have shown that, based on historical U.S. market returns, a starting withdrawal rate of more than 4% per year has led to an undesirably high likelihood of running out of money over the course of a 30-year retirement. Therefore, you’ll want to ensure that your portfolio is at least 25-times (that is, 1 ÷ 4%) the amount that you expect to have to withdraw each year.

### Asset Allocation and Risk Tolerance

The primary factors determining your risk tolerance are:
- The degree of flexibility you have with regard to your financial goals, and
- Your personal comfort level with volatility in your portfolio.
