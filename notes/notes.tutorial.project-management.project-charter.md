A project charter is a key internal document that describes the scope, participants and goals of a project. It contains a clear list of responsibilities, roles and stakeholders. It's usually developed right at the beginning of a project's lifecycle

## What does a Project Charter document contain?

- Basic project information: project name, project sponsor, project manager, main stakeholders & project team members
- General project requirements
- [[Statement of Work|notes.tutorial.project-management.project-charter.statement-of-work]]
- Project activities: project schedule & major milestones
- Initial project budget
- Project constraints, assumptions, risks & dependencies
- Project success criteria
- Project authorization & approval documents

## What's the Difference?

- Project Proposal: 
    - comes first. It is intended to persuade the stakeholders by explaining why the project should be carried out
- Project Charter:
    - is a document that formalizes a specific project's existence. It authorizes the initiation of a given project
- Statement of Work (SoW):
    - Statements of work usually come before project charters and act as their foundation
    - SoWs normally provide an overview of project scope, business needs, deliverables, and measurable project objectives and criteria
- Project plan:
    - Think of a project charter as step one in the project planning process... if all goes well, project charters grow into project plans as their progress in their project schedules and lifecycles
    - Project plans are more dynamic documents than project charters,  they're normally updated frequently and are often used both internally and externally
