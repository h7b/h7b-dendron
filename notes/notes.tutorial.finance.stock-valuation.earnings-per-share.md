# Earnings per Share (EPS)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp)

EPS indicates how much money a company makes for each share of its stock and is a widely used metric for estimating corporate value, or served as an indicator of a company's profitability.

A higher EPS indicates greater value because investors will pay more for a company's shares if they think the company has higher profits relative to its share price.

## Formula

Earnings per share value is calculated as net income (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares.

$$EPS = \frac{Net\ Income - Preferred\ Dividends}{End-of-period\ Common\ Shares\ Outstanding}$$

To calculate a company's EPS, the balance sheet and income statement are used to find the period-end number of common shares, dividends paid on preferred stock (if any), and the net income or earnings. It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term because the number of shares can change over time.

Any stock dividends or splits that occur must be reflected in the calculation of the weighted average number of [[shares outstanding|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.shares-outstanding]].

## Understanding EPS

When the capital structure of a company includes items such as stock options, warrants, or restricted stock units (RSU), these investments—if exercised—could increase the total number of shares outstanding in the market. This is the `dilutive effect` of shares that could be issued by the company

$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{Net\ Income - Preferred\ Dividends}{Weighted\ Average\ Shares\ Outstanding + Conversion\ of\ Dilutive\ Securities}$$

Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) calculates a company’s earnings per share if all convertible securities were converted.

It is important to always judge EPS in relation to the company’s share price, such as by looking at the company’s [[P/E ratio|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.price-earnings-ratio]] or [[earnings yield|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.earnings-yield]].
