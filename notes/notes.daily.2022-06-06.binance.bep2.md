# BEP-2

[BEP-2](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-2) is a technical standard for the issuance and implementation of tokens on the Binance Chain (aka BNB Beacon Chain).

The native asset of Binance Chain is BNB, which is used to pay for fees (similar to [gas](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-ethereum#what-is-ethereum-gas)).

Binance Chain was launched by Binance in April 2019. Its primary focus is to facilitate fast, decentralized (or [non-custodial](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/custody)) trading.

Due to limitations inherent to [blockchain](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-blockchain-technology-a-comprehensive-guide-for-beginners) systems, however, the chain doesn't have much flexibility – [smart contracts](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-smart-contracts) in a system optimized for fast trading could significantly congest the network. [Scalability](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-scalability-sidechains-and-payment-channels) remains one of the most challenging hurdles to blockchain development. And that’s where [[Binance Smart Chain|notes.daily.2022-06-06.binance.bep20]] comes in.
