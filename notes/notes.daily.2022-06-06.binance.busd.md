# BUSD

## Overview

[BUSD](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-busd) is a regulated, fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The supply of BUSD is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Paxos, the token's issuer, releases [monthly attestations](https://paxos.com/attestations/) of BUSD's reserves.

Balance of BUSD in circulation on 2022-04-29 is $17.6B

As a [[stablecoin|notes.daily.2022-06-06.stablecoin]], BUSD is designed to maintain a stable market value. It allows investors and traders to hold a low-volatility asset on the blockchain without the need to exit the crypto space.

There are 2 types of BUSD
- BUSD (ERC-20) issued by Paxos, regulated by New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS)
- BUSD (BEP-20) issued by Binance, not regulated by NYSDFS

## What exactly is BUSD?

BUSD is a stablecoin founded by Paxos and Binance. [Paxos](https://paxos.com/) uses blockchain technology to offer their Stablecoin as a Service product to external companies. In the past, they also created a gold-backed stablecoin called [[notes.daily.2022-06-10.paxg]]. The NYSDFS regulates both BUSD and PAXG tokens.

On a technical level, BUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin that maintains a U.S. dollar peg. An amount of U.S. dollars equal to the total supply of BUSD is held in custody by Paxos, acting as its reserves in FDIC-insured U.S. banks or backed by U.S. Treasuries.

BUSD offers three key attributes to transactions: accessibility, flexibility, and speed. The token is easily accessible through Paxos or Binance. You can purchase them through Binanceâ€™s exchange or fiat gateway services, or send an amount in U.S. dollars to Paxos to mint new BUSD tokens for you.

Paxos issues BUSD on the [Ethereum](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-ethereum) blockchain. 

In addition, Binance offers a Binance-Peg BUSD token on [[BNB Smart Chain|notes.daily.2022-06-06.binance.bep20]]. Binance creates BUSD (BEP-20) by holding BUSD (ERC-20) in an Ethereum blockchain address and minting peg BUSD (BEP-20) tokens, each of which corresponds to a BUSD (ERC-20) token held in reserve by Binance.

BUSD (ERC-20) and BUSD (BEP-20) holders can swap their tokens between the blockchains depending on their needs. This can be done on the Binance exchange (when making withdrawals) or through Binance Bridge. Binance-Peg BUSD (BEP-20) is a Binance product; it is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.

## How does BUSD work?

Each BUSD is exchangeable for 1 USD from the reserves. By sending your BUSD to Paxos, they will burn your tokens and provide you with the fiat currency. This mechanism keeps the supply and reserves at a constant 1:1 ratio.

## How is BUSD regulated?

New York state regulators have enforced particular measures on Paxos, and how the stablecoin must operate. Along with making sure the token is fully collateralized, Paxos must carefully control the creation and burning of BUSD tokens. Paxos also has the right to freeze accounts and remove funds if needed due to illegal activity. These principles all adhere to the Trust Charter and New York banking laws applicable to the stablecoin.

Inbuilt within the smart contracts of the token is a new function that reflects the regulation of the stablecoin: SetLawEnforcementRole. This small piece of code allows Paxos to use the powers mentioned previously in upholding NYDFS regulations.

These features only apply to the Paxos-issued BUSD (ERC-20). Binance-issued BUSD (BEP-20), operates pursuant to different procedures and is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the NYDFS.
