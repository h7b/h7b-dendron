# How do I limit the charging of laptop's battery at certain level?

In order to increase the battery health, HP implemented a function called `Battery Care Function` to limit the charging of battery at a predefined level.

For laptop HP Pavillon 15, I modified the settings from BIOS config.

- Restart / Boot up
- F10 to enter BIOS config
- Go to `System Configuration` tab
- Change the setting named `Battery Care Function`
    - There are 3 predefined level: 100%, 80% and 50%
    - I currently set 50%
