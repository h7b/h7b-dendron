# AVWAP and How to Use It

Anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (AVWAP)

## Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

VWAP means the volume weighted average price. It is the average price that traders pay for a stock in any time frame, session, or interval.

$$VWAP = \frac{\displaystyle\sum(Price*Volume)}{Volume}$$

On a price chart, VWAP is simply a line that starts new at the start of every day's market. 

Traders often use VWAP in various ways 
- as support and resistance levels on the intraday chart, to gauge trend 
    - VWAP moving up signifies an uptrend 
    - and it moving down shows a downtrend
- to anticipate reversals if price goes far away from the VWAP

However, the main limitation of VWAP is that it resets at the start of every day. Therefore, it is not possible for swing traders to use it since it is calculated based on a single day's data only.

## Anchored VWAP

anchored VWAP was introduced, which anchored the VWAP from a certain point. The only difference here is that instead of starting VWAP from the start of the day, we are allowed to start it from anywhere.
