Qualified dividends must meet the following requirements, as outlined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS):
- The dividend must have been paid by a U.S. company or a qualifying foreign company
- The dividends are not listed with the IRS as those that do not qualify
- The required dividend holding period has been met [^1]

## Taxation

The maximum rates for qualified dividends are:
- 0% if your ordinary income is taxed at 10% or 15%
- 15% if you are taxed at a rate greater than 15% but less than 37%
- 20% if your ordinary income is taxed at 37% [^1]

## The Holding Period

The IRS requires investors to hold shares for a minimum period of time to benefit from the lower tax rate on qualified dividends.
- At least 60 days for a common stock
- 90 days for a preferred stock
- 60 days for a dividend-paying mutual fund [^1]

Example:
- Company ABC declares 25-cent dividends per share. 
- If an investor owns 10,000 shares of ABC Corporation common stock, the dividend payment received is $2,500. 
- If the [ex-dividend date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways&text=The%20ex-dividend%20date%20of,%2C%20or%20after%2C%20are%20not.) is July 1, the investor needs to have owned the stock for more than 60 days from May 2 through Oct. 30, or the 121-day period, for the payout to be considered a qualified dividend.
