# Full Calendar

- GitHub: https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar
- Thoughts:
    - display a calendar in Obsidian
    - Keep each event in a calendar as a separate note in your Obsidian vault. This is currently the only option for editable events in Full Calendar [^1]
    - add any remote calendar in `.ics` format into Obsidian [^2]
    - alternatives: [Fantasy Calendars](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/obsidian-fantasy-calendar)
- Read [documentation](https://davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/)
- Demo ![calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/main/docs/assets/sample-calendar.png){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- Update
    - [Release 0.9.0](https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/releases/tag/0.9.0)
        - the events can be written in Daily Notes ![daily-note](https://davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/assets/dailynote.gif){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
