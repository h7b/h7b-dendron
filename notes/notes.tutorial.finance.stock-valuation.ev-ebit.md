# EV to EBIT (EV/EBIT)
ref: [WallStreetMojo](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/ev-to-ebit/), [ValueSignals](https://www.valuesignals.com/Glossary/Details/EV_to_EBIT)

[[EV|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.entreprise-value]] to [[EBIT|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.ebit]] multiple gives the answer to the query "What is the company’s valuation worth per Operating Profit dollar?"

## Formula

$$EV/EBIT=\frac{EV}{EBIT}$$

where
![[notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.entreprise-value#formula,1:#*]]

![[notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.ebit#formula,1:#*]]

## Interpretation
This ratio is an improved version of the traditional P/E multiple that overcomes the limitations of PE ratio as it also has taken a balance sheet into consideration. Therefore, rather than just using the company’s share price, the company employs enterprise value that also includes debt

This ratio is the opposite of [[Earning Yields|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.ebit-ev]]. 

A flaw when sorting companies based on Earnings Yield
- companies with a small enterprise value and positive EBIT will show up at the top of the list but as soon as the EV becomes negative, the stock will drop to the bottom of the list
- similarly, stocks with a negative EBIT and a negative EV are likely to feature at the top of the list

The EV/EBIT ratio will prevent the previous behavior
- stocks with a negative EBIT get a blank score
- by sorting stocks ascending, stocks where the EV becomes negative don't get sent to the bottom of the list
