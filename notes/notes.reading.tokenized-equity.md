## Notes from reading

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tokenized-equity.asp)  
Tokenized equity refers to the creation and issuance of digital tokens or "coins" that represent equity shares in a corporation or organization.

The underlying blockchain infrastructure also supports all necessary activities applicable to the tokenized equity shares. For example, all popular corporate actions like dividends, mergers, and acquisitions, and other activities like shareholder voting and follow-on equity sale offers are also handled by the necessary blockchain system.

For instance, [Templum](https://www.templuminc.com/) is one such blockchain-based platform that is aiming to become the leading regulatory-compliant platform for tokenized asset offerings and their secondary trading.
