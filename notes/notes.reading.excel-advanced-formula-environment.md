## Notes from reading

It's interesting to see another approach to custom user defined functions by Microsoft. It's possibly easier to create for Excel users versus the [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) solution from Google. Though it means that we should also prepare for lots of mess from novice citizen developers.
