# Shares Outstanding
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp)

Shares outstanding refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders.

Outstanding shares are shown on a company’s balance sheet under the heading "Capital Stock".

## [Stock Split](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp)
- A stock split is when a company increases the number of its outstanding shares to boost the stock's liquidity
  - a company often decides on a split when the stock price is quite high, making it expensive for investors to acquire a standard board lot of 100 shares
  - the higher number of shares outstanding can result in greater liquidity for the stock, which facilitates trading and may narrow the bid-ask spread
- Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the share price drops in proportion to that multiple, because the split does not make the company more valuable
- Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, in which a company lowers, instead of increasing, the number of shares outstanding, raising the share price accordingly

## Share Repurchase Programs

If a company considers its stock to be undervalued, it will institute a repurchase program, buying back shares of its own stock.

The purpose of the repurchase 
- eliminate the shareholder dilution that will occur from future employee stock option or equity grants
- increase its earnings per share by using its existing cash, for companies with large cash reserves on their balance sheets
