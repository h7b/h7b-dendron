# Income Tax
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp)

The term income tax refers to a type of tax that governments impose on income generated by businesses and individuals within their jurisdiction.

Personal income tax is a type of income tax that is levied on an individual's wages, salaries, and other types of income.

Income taxes are calculated based on tax filing status (married or separate) and the individual's taxable income.

The U.S. has a multitiered income tax system under which taxes are imposed by federal and state.

## [Federal Income Tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal_income_tax.asp)

Federal income taxes are based on your income and filing status, not by where you live.

The federal income tax is built on a progressive tax system, where higher income earners are taxed at higher rates.

### 2022 Federal Income Tax Brackets and Rates

The tax brackets and their [marginal tax rates](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/marginaltaxrate.asp) for 2022 [^1]

| 2022 Marginal Tax Rate | For Single Individuals/ Married Filing Separately | Married Filing Jointly | Heads of Households |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 10% | $0 to $10,275 | $0 to $20,550 | $0 to $14,650 |
| 12%  | $10,275 to $41,775 | $20,550 to $83,550 | $14,650 to $55,900 |
| 22%  | $41,775 to $89,075 | $83,550 to $178,150 | $55,900 to $89,050 |
| 24%  | $89,075 to $170,050 | $178,150 to $340,100 | $89,050 to $170,050 |
| 32%  | $170,050 to $215,950 | $340,100 to $431,900 | $170,050 to $215,950 |
| 35%  | $215,950 to $539,900 | $431,900 to $647,850 | $215,950 to $539,900 |
| 37%  | $539,900 or more | $647,850 or more | $539,900 or more |

### Example

An individual who is unmarried and earns $80,000 annually falls into the 22% marginal tax bracket. This means the taxpayer would be responsible for $13,223 in taxes (for 2021 [^2]), the breakdown for which is illustrated in the table below.

| Dollars | Amount Subject to Tax | Tax Rate | Tax at Each Rate |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| $0~$9,950 | $9,950  | 10% | $995  |
| $9,950~$41,775 | $31,825  | 12% | $3,819  |
| $41,775~$80,000 | $38,225  | 22% | $8,409  |
| Total | $80,000  | - | $13,223 tax bill |

While the marginal rate is 22%, the effective tax rate (the actual rate the individual ends up paying in taxes to the government) is 16.5%. This figure is arrived at by dividing the total tax bill ($13,223) by income ($80,000).

## [State Income Tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/state-income-tax.asp)

In the U.S., governments at the state level may also levy income taxes in addition to federal income taxes.

Not all states have state-level income taxes.
- Currently, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming don’t have an income tax. 
- New Hampshire taxes dividends and interest income only, but the state will completely phase out these taxes by 2027

### Example

Consider a single taxpayer who lives in Utah and reports taxable earned income of $75,000 a year plus interest income of $3,000 on their federal tax return.
- In terms of state taxes:
    - all of their taxable income—both earned and unearned—would be subject to that state's 4.95% flat tax rate. In that case, their state tax bill would be $3,861 ($78,000 × 0.0495) [^4]
- In terms of federal taxes:
    - under the progressive system, the total federal tax bill of this taxpayer would be $12,248.40, which is equivalent to an effective federal tax rate of 16.3%

### California state income tax
