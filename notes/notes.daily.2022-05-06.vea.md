# [Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets (VEA)](https://etfdb.com/etf/VEA/#etf-ticker-profile)

## Overview

- Expense Ratio: 0.05%
- Inception: 2007-07-20
- NAV as of 2022-05-05: $43.71
- Index tracked: [FTSE Developed ex US All Cap Net Tax (US RIC) Index](https://etfdb.com/index/ftse-developed-ex-us-all-cap-net-tax-us-ric-index/)

### Analyst report

- This ETF offers exposure to developed markets outside of North America, including Western Europe, Japan, and Australia. As such, VEA is a core holding of many long-term portfolios, and can also be used as an efficient tool for overweighting ex-U.S. developed markets
- This ETF is impressive in both its depth of holdings (nearly 1,000 component securities) and cost efficiency (VEA is considerably cheaper than iShares' EFA, which seeks to replicate the same index)
- Compelling alternatives: the equal-weighted EWEF may offer an attractive weighting methodology, as does the RAFI-weighted PXF (which also includes Canadian stocks)
- VEA is heavy on exposure to large caps, introducing potential sector biases; the small cap focused SCZ can deliver complementary exposure
