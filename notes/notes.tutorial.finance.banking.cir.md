# Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) aka Efficiency ratio

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiencyratio.asp), [FinanceTalking](https://www.financetalking.com/_popup-financial-glossary.php?id=195)

The Cost-Income ratio (CIR) aka Efficiency ratio measures operating costs as a percentage of operating income.

Banks hope to reduce their cost income ratio as the business grows thanks to economies of scale. The idea is that additional revenue from existing or new customers has a relatively low cost associated with it and so is increasingly profitable.

For banks, the efficiency ratio is $\frac{non-interest\ expenses}{revenue}$. 

A lower efficiency ratio means that a bank is operating better.

This shows how well the bank's managers control their overhead (or back-office) expenses. This ratio allows analysts to assess the performance of commercial and investment banks.
