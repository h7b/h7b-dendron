Off-balance sheet (OBS) items are an accounting practice whereby a company does not include a liability on its balance sheet.

While not recorded on the balance sheet itself, these items are nevertheless assets and liabilities of the company.

Off-balance sheet items are an important concern for investors when assessing a company's financial health. Off-balance sheet items are often difficult to identify and track within a company's financial statements because they often only appear in the accompanying notes.

OBS items are not inherently intended to be deceptive or misleading, although they can be misused by bad actors to be deceptive. 
- Certain businesses routinely keep substantial off-balance sheet items. For example, investment management firms are required to keep clients' investments and assets off-balance sheet. 
- For most companies, off-balance sheet items exist in relation to financing, enabling the company to maintain compliance with existing financial covenants. 
- Off-balance sheet items are also used to share the risks and benefits of assets and liabilities with other companies, as in the case of joint venture (JV) projects.

The Enron scandal was one of the first developments to bring the use of off-balance-sheet entities to the public's attention. 
- In Enron's case, the company would build an asset such as a power plant and immediately claim the projected profit on its books even though it hadn't made one dime from it
- If the revenue from the power plant was less than the projected amount, instead of taking the loss, the company would then transfer these assets to an off-the-books corporation, where the loss would go unreported

Typical types of Off-Balance Sheet Items:
- Operating Lease
    - The company leasing the asset only accounts for the monthly rental payments and other fees associated with the rental rather than listing the asset and corresponding liability on its own balance sheet
- Leaseback Agreements
    - Under a leaseback agreement, a company can sell an asset, such as a piece of property, to another entity. They may then lease that same property back from the new owner
    - Like an operating lease, the company only lists the rental expenses on its balance sheet, while the asset itself is listed on the balance sheet of the owning business
- Accounts Receivables (AR)
    - Instead of listing this AR risk-laden asset on its own balance sheet, companies can essentially sell this asset to another company, called a factor, which then acquires the risk associated with the asset
    - The factor pays the company a percentage of the total value of all AR upfront and takes care of collection. Once customers have paid up, the factor pays the company the balance due minus a fee for services rendered. In this way, a business can collect what is owed while outsourcing the risk of default
