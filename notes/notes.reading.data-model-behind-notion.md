## Notes from reading

Everything you see in Notion is a block. Text, images, lists, a row in a database, even pages themselves â€” these are all blocks, dynamic units of information that can be transformed into other block types or moved freely within Notion

The content attribute of a block is what stores the array of block IDs (or pointers) referencing those nested blocks
