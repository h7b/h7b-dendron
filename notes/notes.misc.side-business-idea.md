# My fantasy of wealth management business

I want to build a business in wealth management sector.

Is there an equivalent entity of [Regulated Investment Company (RIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ric.asp) in Vietnam?

## Some interesting UI/UX that inspired me to implement

[Percento](https://www.percento.app/)
- distribution of assets
  ![asset-distribution](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/2022-02-03_percento_IMG_0423_leWFPuqvQ.PNG?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1643855111674){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- history of transactions
  ![history-of-transaction](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/2022-02-03_percento_IMG_0426_GEx7jLTfC.PNG?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1643855112014){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- list of account, bird view

- list of accounts, detail view

        - My thoughts: 0,11 % de frais mensuels. It is equivalent to 1.32% per annum, which is almost double of the already high expense ratio of a thematic ETF like [ARKK](https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/). I'm not sure how can they convince their customers for such a high premium without being backed by any historical performances

- [Investment strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundsmith): looks for companies generating high returns on capital and operating in sectors driven by a large number of everyday, repeat events and transactions, such as consumer staples and medical consumables. It avoids emerging technology firms, owing to their inherent unpredictability; it also avoids firms in heavily cyclical industries, such as airlines and real estate. Fundsmith also looks for companies with an established competitive advantage.
