A project proposal is a document that describes an external or internal project. It states details like goals, objectives, important dates, milestones and requirements needed to start and complete the project.

Your project proposal should whet decision-makers' appetites, clearly communicate your ideas while winning buy-in and those all-important resources and budgets you need to make it happen.

## A project proposal outline breakdown
- Introduction: It's essentially your elevator pitch to your project while summarizing what the reader can expect
- Proposed problem and solution
- Proposed method to fix the problem 
- Request for resources 
- Authorization: Include internal and external stakeholders that are responsible for making this project a success, as well as the time frame they'll have to give the go-ahead for each stage of the project. 
- Conclusion: Finish on a positive note and focus on the benefits your project will bring the company
