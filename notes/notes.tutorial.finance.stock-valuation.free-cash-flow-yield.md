Free cash flow yield is a financial solvency ratio that compares the free cash flow per share a company is expected to earn against its market value per share.

Free Cash Flow Yield: A Fundamental Indicator

## Formula

$$Free\ Cash\ Flow\ Yield = \frac{Free\ Cash\ Flow\ per\ Share}{Market\ Price\ per\ Share}$$

## What Does the Free Cash Flow Yield Reveal?

The free cash flow yield gives investors an idea of how financially capable a company is at having quick access to cash in case of unexpected debts or other obligations, or how much cash would be available if the company had to be liquidated.
- Generally, the lower the ratio, the less attractive a company is as an investment. Because it means investors are putting money into the company but not receiving a very good return in exchange. 
- A high free cash flow yield result means a company is generating enough cash to easily satisfy its debt and other obligations, including dividend payouts.

While accounting-based earnings reporting in principle summarize a company's total net income, cash flow concerns a company's ability to sustain its ongoing operations. The more cash a company amasses from operations, the easier it is to continue carrying out its business and to ultimately generate more earnings. The ability to yield cash flow can be a better indication of a company's longer-term valuation.
