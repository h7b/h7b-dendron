## Notes from reading

Here is a graph showing $1 doubling at different interest rates.

This is a trick that allows us to mentally estimate annual compound interest amounts, where we are interested in doubling our money

> If we want to know how long it will take for our money to double, just divide 72 by the interest rate

So for example, if the interest rate is 10%,

72 รท 10 = 7.2 years

So it will take just over 7 years to double our money
