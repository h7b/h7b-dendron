## Notes from reading

[Compare AsciiDoc vs Markdown](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/asciidoc-vs-markdown/)

Markdown: 
- was created to make the source readable
- was an attempt to take all of those community-accepted formatting conventions and standardize it into a single format
- is a formalisation of conventions which were in common in email & news long before HTML even existed

The main advantages of AsciiDoc:
- more flexible/powerful formatting options
- letting you implement a ton of structural/metadata type stuff with a syntax that is more complicated than Markdown but far simpler than XML

MyST - Markedly Structured Text:
- extending CommonMark to merge with a lot of the strengths from reStructuredText
- implement [directives](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html#directives-a-block-level-extension-point) in Markdown as a standard format for special properties to things like images, admonitions, and for entry points for plugins to integrate well directly within the Markdown
