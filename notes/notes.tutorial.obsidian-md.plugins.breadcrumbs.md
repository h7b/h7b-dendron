## Use Breadcrumbs plugin to navigate the hierarchical notes in Dendron vault

With a recent patch to v2.9.1, the [Breadcrumbs plugin](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs) now can be used to navigate the hierarchy of notes in Dendron vault. 
Here is the screen cap from mobile ios. As in the photo, on the right pane, `up` means go back to parent of current active note. Looks awesome.

Now Obsidian with Breadcrumbs plugin is great to read and edit Dendron notes on mobile. 

Then a problem now is how to include only `.vault` folder of Dendron into a vault folder of Obsidian, so the icloud sync for Obsidian is not flooded by the swarms of files in` .next` folder of Dendron

I need only the *Breadcrumbs* plugin for Obsidian to navigate the hierarchy structure of Dendron notes, without modifying the frontmatter of each notes.

**Update 2021-12-31:**

The situation is even better after I used the [[Netlify publishing workflow|notes.tutorial.dendron.publish-netlify#publish-my-dendron-vault-using-netlify]]. My dendron folder now is not flooded by thousands of files from `node_modules` and `.next` folder. So I can put my Dendron folder directly inside an iCloud Drive folder to sync with my iPhone. 

From there I can open, edit and navigate the hierarchy structure of my Dendron vault using Obsidian on iOS

This is basically a game changer workflow for me. It means that I can edit my Dendron vault on the fly on mobile. When Iâ€™m on desk, the change will sync to my laptop via iCloud. Then i open Dendron workspace to push changes to GitHub repo. Done. My notes are published. So great

**Update 2022-04-01:**

*Breadcrumbs* has its own [codeblocks](https://breadcrumbs-wiki.onrender.com/docs/Codeblocks). I use it to display the hierarchical tree view of notes in Dendron-hierarchy format, by inserting the breadcrumbs codeblock into a specific note.
