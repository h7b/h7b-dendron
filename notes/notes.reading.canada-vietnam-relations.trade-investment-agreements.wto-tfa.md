The WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA), which entered into force on February 22, 2017, contains binding commitments for the 164 WTO Members to modernize and simplify border procedures.

The TFA aim to:
- Expedite release and clearance of goods at the border, 
    - for example by processing import documentation prior to the arrival of goods, and concentrating border controls on high risk goods while expediting the release of low-risk goods
- Streamline customs formalities by cutting bureaucratic [red tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape), 
    - for example by reviewing customs formalities to ensure rapid release and reduced time and cost, and providing a single window for submission of customs documentation and data
    - have favourable effects on small to medium Businesses, making it easier for them to trade and join global value chains
- Provide recourse to traders through a right of appeal or review of administrative decisions by border agencies
- Ensure predictability through advance rulings by customs authorities that provide binding decisions on tariff classification and origin upon request of traders
- Ensure transparency by requiring prior publication of relevant laws and regulations and by allowing traders to comment
