The boundaries between Data Analysis and Data Science are not very clear
- The main differences are that Data Scientists usually have more programming and math skills. They can then apply these skills in Machine Learning and ETL processes
- Data Analysts, on the other hand, have better communication skills, creating better reports, with stronger storytelling abilities.
