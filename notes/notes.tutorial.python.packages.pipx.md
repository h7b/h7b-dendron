# [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

`pipx` is used to install different Python command line tools (CLI) into separate [[virtual environments|notes.tutorial.python.virtual-environment]]. Thus, the dependencies of these tools will not interfere with each other, and you can run each tool without any fear.
