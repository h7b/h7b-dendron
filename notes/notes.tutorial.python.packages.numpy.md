# [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.

Numerical Python, or `NumPy` is mainly used in scientific computing and in data science fields. The heart of NumPy is the high-performance N-dimensional (multidimensional) array data structure. This array allows you to perform mathematical operations on an entire array without looping over the elements. All of the functions in the library are optimized to work with the N-dimensional array objects.
