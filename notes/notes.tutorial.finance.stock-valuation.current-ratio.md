# Current Ratio
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-does-low-working-capital-ratio-show-about-companys-working-capital-management.asp)

The `Current ratio` (aka `Working Capital ratio`) reflects a company's operational efficiency and the health of its short-term finances.

## Formula

$$Current\ ratio = \frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabiliites}$$

where

- [[Current Liabilities|notes.tutorial.finance.stock-valuation.current-liabilities]]

## Understanding Current Ratio

A working capital ratio below 1 suggests that a company may be unable to pay its short-term debts.

Conversely, a working capital ratio that is very high suggests that a company is not effectively managing excess cash flow, which could be better directed towards company growth.

Some analysts believe that the ideal working capital ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0.
